    "title": "Consent & Privacy",
    "content": "Consent & Privacy For more information on Lytics' security and privacy program, please visit Lytics' trust center at https://trust.lytics.com/ Suggest Edits Introduction As businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined: Data Collection : How to collect consent adequately from disparate sources consistently. Profile Materialization : How to flexibly surface the state of consent to individual user profiles. Segmentation : How can the required consent rules be enforced when driving downstream campaigns? Maintenance : How to ensure that your consent strategy scales and flexes to your ongoing market conditions without fail? By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust. Data Collection To maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following: The source of the data and any inherent limitations. Can it be real-time, or does it need to be batch? The granularity of the consent. Is this a simple boolean, on or off, or is this something more granular, like opting into a particular communication method? Additional context related to the consent that may be important for your needs. Are there specific forms that are being consented to or a unique source? To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized via Conductor to meet your specific needs. Data Structure Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively. Schema Property Description Event Name Using a standardized event name for consent collection provides crucial context that can be utilized through if/else rules for individual mappings. By leveraging different event names, such as \"consent-type-1\" versus \"consent-type-2,\" it becomes easier to differentiate between multiple types of consent on a single profile as events stream in and is subsequently mapped. This approach enables businesses to maintain a more granular and organized record of consent-related data. Consented A clear and concise confirmation, or lack thereof, reduces the possibility of accidentally mapping consent when consent has been denied or not yet collected. Location An optional parameter to build context around a user's location that may become important. Are they consenting to something location specific? Date An optional parameter to build context around when consent was most recently given. Date may be important if consent is valid for a specified length of time and may help support efforts to gather consent in the event that the consent timeframe has lapsed. Documents The \"documents\" array within the default schema represents additional context that can be used to specify the source of consent. For instance, this field can indicate whether the consent was given via a global site-wide agreement or a specific call to action during a purchase. While the data manager determines the values and format of this field, including this information helps ensure that critical context is not lost during execution. Examples 📘 We are here to help! Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect. Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline: Collecting Consent via the Web: Lytics JavaScriptTag JavaScript jstag.send({\n  \"event\": \"form-submit\",\t\n  \"consent\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"global\",\n    \"location\": \"Portland, OR\",\n    \"documents\": [\"generic-submit-form\"],\n    \"consented\": true\n  }\n}) Collecting Consent via Mobile: Lytics iOS SDK Lytics.shared.consent(\n  name: \"consent-1\",\n  identifiers: AnyCodable([\n    \"userid\": \"my-fake-userid-1234\"\n  ]),\n  attributes: AnyCodable([\n    \"firstName\": \"Kevin\",\n    \"lastName\": \"McCalister\"\n  ]),\n  consent: AnyCodable([\n    \"documents\": [\n      \"terms_jan_2023\",\n      \"sharing_policy_jan_2023\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Chicago, IL\",\n    \"consented\": true\n  ])\n) 📘 When using Lytics SDKs, you do not have to include date within the data passed in the consent event. The timestamp of the consent event can be used to create the field and mapping for the date of consent. Profile Materialization Building from the collection strategy outlined in Collecting Consent Data , we must determine how to materialize the consent-related data we've just collected to user profiles for segmentation. This can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regardless of the approach, however, it is essential to consider the level of granularity of the consent. Granularity When collecting consent from users, obtaining granular consent for each specific use of a customer's personal data is an important consideration. Granular consent means that customers are provided with a clear understanding of the exact purposes for which their personal data will be used and can choose to consent or withhold consent for each specific use case. For example, a business may seek granular consent from a customer to collect their email address and use it to send them promotional emails but not to share the email address with third-party partners for advertising purposes. This approach allows customers to make more informed decisions about how their personal data is used and provides greater control over their privacy. Obtaining granular consent not only requires careful planning and clear communication with customers about the specific use cases for their personal data but also a rock-solid means for enforcing an individual's consent wishes across all future touchpoints. Schema Enforcement begins by ensuring consent wishes are accurately materialized on each user's profile. This is done by first defining consent-related attributes to be used in segmentation. Field Definition When defining profile fields, there are two primary considerations. What type of field should be used, such as a string or a map and how do you want to handle data merging when profiles are stitched? Field Type Type Benefits Drawbacks Map (Recommended) A map is the most straightforward approach, allowing you to add additional context with minimum overhead. You create one field and map multiple data points to that field. During segmentation, maps may be slightly more challenging to navigate. Because the keys that are nested under the map are not part of the top-level schema, you'll need to drill into the field to build segments vs. searching at the top level. String When building segments, because all consent fields would be at the top level of the schema, it may be easier to find and select the contextual data. When using a string, you can only store a single value. This represents a heavier lift during the initial setup, as you'll need to create many fields to facilitate a single consent use case. Merge Operator Type String Because consent is something that may change for a consumer over time, the values must represent the most recent data. As such, the latest merge operator is always recommended. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a field will win. Example String Type Map For a more complex or granular consent strategy, the map field type can be very helpful in accurately managing consent. As such, the merge merge operator is always recommended when trying to keep the key-value pairs up to date to the most recent consent state. This means that as additional data is stitched to a user profile, the most recent events that are mapped to a key-value pair will win. Example Map Mapping Definition Mappings are then leveraged to determine how data from any number of streams map to the defined field. In the example below, we take a simple approach to map the boolean value of true or false to the consent field if the consent is related to marketing-consent . Though this is one elementary example, the same practice can be replicated to ensure a consent attribute has the status, timestamp, and context of any important policies or sources for segmentation. Example Segmentation Businesses can better understand their customers and create more effective campaigns by breaking down audiences into smaller, more targeted segments. Here we will discuss best practices for constructing \"building block\" audiences related to consent that can then be leveraged in campaign audiences. This progressive approach ensures consent rules are enforced while minimizing ongoing maintenance overhead. Building Blocks Building Block Audience s provide the perfect means to maintain consent-related rules and extend the ruleset to all campaign audiences. The number and these audiences will depend on the granularity of your consent strategy. Still, as a basic example, we recommend creating both a \"has consented\" and \"has not consented\" counterpart for each level of consent. This can be done simply through the GUI for our powerful segmentation engine, as shown below: Campaign Segments Once you have the necessary building blocks constructed, you can quickly integrate that rule set into your campaign audiences again through the GUI for our segmentation engine. The example below outlines a use case where you want to target high-value users who have opted in. Global Job Segment Filter (Consent) Configure a segment to prevent profiles from being sent to downstream destinations based on consent status or another relevant filter. This ensures that individuals who should be excluded will not be activated downstream. API documentation can be found here .

    "title": "Audiences",
    "content": "Audiences Suggest Edits Introduction Audiences are central to creating personalized marketing using Lytics. It is how groups of users get targeted and defines how cross-channel user data is used in campaigns. Lytics offers audiences as a tool that operates on user fields as well as other audiences. This provides the ability to craft audiences that target one user, every user, or any number in between. Lytics audiences are automatically kept up to date. As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly. Audiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting. When all of that isn’t enough, the Lytics APIs provide deep integrations with the Lytics platform. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Creating Audiences Building new audiences allows you to target specific groups of your users. Why send the same email to your entire audience? Instead, send emails to distinct audiences with content that you know those users enjoy. Lytics gives you the ability to create audiences based on cross channel user data, behaviors and interests. Audiences can be built using existing audiences, user content affinity, your personalization campaigns, or by custom rules utilizing any user fields in your Lytics account. Create rulesets by combining multiple audiences and boolean logic to target users with as much or as little granularity as you require. Lytics updates your audiences automatically. Once an audience is built, users will join or leave whenever they match (or fail to match) the rules you have set. Export your audiences, often in real-time, to your integrated marketing tools giving you the power of Lytics however you engage with your users. 📘 Access the audience builder from Lytics navigation menu by expanding the Audiences tab and clicking Audiences . Once on the Audiences page, click on the + Create New Audience button. Building Audiences: Existing Audiences The Existing Audiences tab in the audience builder contains a list of all existing audiences and their size categorized by audience type such as characteristic. Characteristics are pre-built audiences pertaining to single user attributes such as location or behavior. Keep in mind that the audience sizes you see in this list are not real-time. They are updated every few hours for performance reasons. When creating or editing an audience, however, you will always see real-time numbers so that you can make precise decisions based on accurate data. You can use the Filter by Audience Type drop-down to filter the list or use the Search box to quickly find an audience by name. Select an audience or characteristic to add it to the definition of the audience you are building or editing. Building Audiences: Content Affinity The Content Affinity tab in the audience builder is used to add Affinity-based rules to your audience. Since Affinities are a group of related Topics , this allows you to effectively target users interested in several subjects or products. In the example above, we created a \"Lavender\" Affinity for an online beauty store, which includes 6 Topics such as \"lavender\", \"lavender lotion\", and \"lavender luxury.\" Instead of creating an audience with 6 rules (one per Topic), we just select our Lavender Affinity that contains those 6 Topics. Once you choose an Affinity for your audience, you will be able to select the range of affinity values. The histogram displays the distribution of user interest for the selected Affinity and is helpful to build an audience that has the desired size. By default, users with Any Affinity are selected. You can choose a built-in range by clicking any of the Affinity buttons or, to set a custom range, use the slider to refine the range of users to target. As you change the range, the total number of users that fit the range is shown in the right column. As soon as you create an Affinity, Lytics start scoring users against it as they interact with your content or products. For active users, you can expect this number to start populating within a few days. For inactive users, it can take up to 2 weeks for them to be scored against an Affinity. So it's recommended that you create Affinities in advance of the audience needed for an Affinity-based campaign. Topic-Based Audiences Under the Custom Rule tab in the Audience Builder, you can find the existing audiences based on Topics in your content taxonomy. If you want to create new audiences based on a single Topic, you can do so as follows: Search for \"Topics\" in the Custom Rule tab of the Audience Builder Select the Topic of interest. Set the threshold according to the desired users' level of interest in that Topic. Once you hit \"Add Condition\", the custom rule for a Topic will look like this: Although Topics are still supported in the Audience Builder, we strongly recommend you use Affinities to build audiences for a more efficient workflow and more effective targeting. Inferred Content Affinity Some users may find a field named Inferred Content Affinity when trying to build affinity or topic based audiences. This field contains topics that a user could be interested in even though they may not have interacted with the topics directly. To learn more about how these inferrences are made, you can read about our content taxonomy process . Note that topic affinity already includes this information, but this field contains only inferred affinity. We would also recommend not using this field to build audiences as it is not a wholistic view of a user's affinity. Building Audiences: Custom Rules The Custom Rules tab in the audience builder is used to add any rule based on a user field to the audience being built or edited. Custom rules allow for ultimate access of all data that is aggregated in user fields. Custom rules are simple statements that can be combined to create very precise audiences. Using them correctly requires a thorough understanding of the data being used, but there is no replacement for this level of segmentation. 🚧 Audiences Field Value Limits Audiences can have a maximum of 1,000 field values. \"Values\" in this context apply to a single evaluation against a user field. When exceeded, the error message \"Audience too large! Remove values to save this audience\" will be displayed. For example, the following scenarios would trigger the alert: An audience with a single rule that supports multiple values ( e.g. contains one of) with 1001+ values. An audience with 1001+ user field rules each with a single evaluation (e.g. exists). Any variation in between such as two rules each containing over 500 evaluations, etc. The user field list displays all the fields in your account. The Source drop-down can be used to filter on the data stream the user field came from. The Includes drop-down can be used to filter user fields on the percentage of users that have a field. Use the Search input to search for a user field by name. Generally, to add a Custom Rule to an audience definition: Choose a User Field Choose an operator (e.g., text contains, value is less than) Choose a value There are variations to this general procedure based on the type of the user field and the operator chosen. User Field Types How you work with user fields in the Custom Rules tab will depend on way the field is mapped in on the user profile. Numeric User Fields Numeric user fields are most commonly used for data that is counted. For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed. Examples: Total Number of Visits must equal 5: Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule. Total Number of Visits must be less than 3: Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule. Text User Fields Text User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match. There are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields: Equal : The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar. Contain : The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field. Be Like : Use the wildcard character * along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g., test will only match on the exact string test, while test* will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and *test* will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\". Equal one of : Add each, exact value you want included individually. A new search bar will appear after each selection. You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”. Exist : Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field. Examples First Name must equal Ash: Only users named Ash will be matched. First name must contain Ash: Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.” Date User Fields Date user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a direction in time for your custom rule. Your starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups). Since each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time. Some date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule. Examples Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016: Created by selecting Specific Date and the direction Before . This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June. Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past: Created by selecting Relative Date , entering 3 days In the past and selecting the direction After . This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days. Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days: Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date. Create the first rule by selecting Relative Date , After , entering 0 Days , selecting In the past , and clicking Add Condition . Create the second rule by selecting Relative Date , Before , 30 Days , In the future , and clicking Add Condition . This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date. Set User Fields Set user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently. Examples All URL Paths Ever must contain one of /blog , /products , or /about : Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched. Followed Sports must contain Baseball: Any user who follows Baseball will be matched. This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling. Map/Nested User Fields Map user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance, Events By Device is a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count. The device could be thought of as an additional, dynamic user field that is nested under the map user field. Selecting a Key When using a map user field, the first step is selecting the dynamic user field to build a rule with, called a key . Using the URLs Visited example, the keys could include any numeric value. Since these keys are dynamic,  counts will be updated automatically. Building the Condition Once a key is selected a condition is built. The type of the nested user field is called the value type . In the case of URLs Visited , the value type is numeric. When building audiences with nested fields, the visualization chart will not display for mapped fields to minimize page load times. Examples Events By Device (Desktop) must be greater than 5: Only users who have visited the website more than 5 times on a desktop will be matched. If a user has visited more than 5 times on the mobile web, they will not be matched. Signup Date for Event (Personalization Webinar) must be within the last 7 days: Only the users who signed up for the Personalization Webinar in the last week will be matched. Users who signed up more than 7 days ago will not be matched. Users who signed up for a different event in the last 7 days will also not be matched. Out of the Box Custom Rules Some user fields are mapped by default and populated through the use of the Lytics Javascript tag and Experiences. These out of the box fields can be incredibly useful when building audiences using Custom Rules. Lytics Javascript Tag Assuming that you have not made changes to the 'default' web LQL file that is automatically created when the Lytics Javascript Tag is installed, the following custom rules are available to you for use when building audiences. Rule Description All channels used (web, email, etc.) All the channels a user has been active in based on the data imported into your Lytics account. Bot The Lytics JavaScript Tag captures information from the web browser to determine if the user is bot or not. When data is collected from the Lytics JavaScript Tag, that request will include the user-agent of the client that was used to initiate the request. The user agent is parsed and evaluated using a third party library . That evaluation determines if the request is from a \"bot\" or not. NOTE : The third party library does not capture all bots. Created Timestamp The timestamp of when a user profile was created. When an anonymous and known profile is merged the oldest timestamp is retained. Devices Used Any devices a user has used e.g. desktop, Android, iOS. Event First Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the first event sent through from your website by either your tag manager or the Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Event Last Time Seen Captures the timestamp of the last event sent through from your website from either your tag manager or our Lytics JavaScript Tag, along with some details around what that event was. Last Active The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on web or any connected sources importing activity data to your account. Last Activity by Channel The last timestamp on the profile that indicated activity on a particular channel. Last Visit City Pulled from visit_city field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit Country Pulled from visit_country field from your Default (web) source and indicates the last value seen. Last Visit State/Province Pulled from visit_region field from your Default (web) source and indicated last value seen. Modified Timestamp The last time that a profile was updated. Random, uniform partition of users Every profile in Lytics is assigned a random number between 1-100. By using this rule, you can perform simple A/B tests to decrease the size of an audience for testing down to a certain percentage of the total audience size. Read more about simple AB testing. Score Frequency, Intensity, Momentum, Propensity, Quntatiy, or Recency. The values of the user's Lytics behavorial scores. See Lytics Scores for detailed descriptions of these fields. Time of First Visit The time of a user’s first visit to your website since the Lytics JavaScript Tag was installed. Time of Last Visit The time of a user’s last website visit. Timezone The timezone they are in based on their last web session. Total Number of Visits Total number of different times a user has come to your website. Total Pageview Count A user’s lifetime total of pageviews. User Agent The last browser user agent of the user e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Web Cookie ID(current) The cookie id of the last session a user had on your website. Web Cookie IDs(all) All of the cookie ids tied to a user. Web Domains Visited All the domains a user has visited that have the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed. Web Events by Hour Number of tracked events for each hour of the day in 24 hour UTC time . Web Events by Week Number of tracked events for each hour in a week. Experiences There are a variety of use cases that involve targeting users who have engaged with previous marketing campaigns. For example, if a user converted on an Iterable Experience email, and you want to follow up with an SMS message. The steps below will walk you through how to create an audience to target users who were reached by or clicked on an Experience . Navigate to Experiences and search for the one you would like to use. You will need to get an ID for the Experience, which differs depending on the Experience type: For Lytics Web Personalization Experiences : Look up the URL for this Experience and locate the long string of numbers of letters as highlighted below. Save this to your clipboard. For all other Experience types : open developer tools and navigate to the “Network” tab. Refresh the page and filter the requests by “experience”. Find the response that looks similar to the example below, and save the external_id value (nested under vehicle ) to your clipboard. Note: You can also use the Experience API to fetch the current Experience by ID to get the full payload, including the Experience's external_id . In your Lytics account, navigate to Audiences > Create New Audience . In the audience builder, select Custom Rule and search for the provider of the Experience you would like to segment on. After you enter a provider, you should see a field for conversions and reach on those Experience types. Select the action you wish to segment off of. Copy and paste the ID you copied from step 2 into the text box. Choose Exist as your operator and add the condition to your audience. Select Add Condition . You now have an audience based on past interactions with an Experience. You can save the audience as is, or continue to add rules based on your use case. Building Audiences: Multiple Rules and Rule Sets All audience definitions are comprised of rules based on existing audiences , content affinity , campaigns , and custom rules . You may have noticed that after you add your first rule in the audience builder you have the option to Add New Rule or Add New Rule Set . Adding new rules and rulesets, and setting the conditions for their interaction, gives you the ability to refine which users your audiences target. Working With Multiple Rules This audience has a single rule: included all users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . This will select all users with an intensity score of 20 or less but with a frequency score of 20 or greater. These are users who interact often but not on a deep level. You can refine this rule further by clicking Add New Rule . This audience now also includes a rule for users who have a low content affinity for Technology content. Now that it has been added, there are three numbers of interest. The first number, 87,650, is the number of users with the characteristic Behavior: Perusers . The second number, 466,730, is the number of users who have low affinity for Technology content. The third number, 11,514, are the users who meet both of these conditions. Clicking the And/Or toggle, will switch the way the two rules intereact. The audience now includes all 542,921 users who either have the characteristic Behavior: Perusers or have low afffinity for Technology content. Excluding Rules In addition to the And/Or toggle, there is the Included/Excluded toggle. This toggle inverts a condition. This audience contains a rule that targets the 159,084 users with the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile or users who have used a mobile devices. Clicking the Include/Exclude toggle the audience will now target the 705,166 users who do not have the characteristic Browser / OS: Mobile . The sum of the two numbers will be the total audience size that meets those rule(s). This is especially apparent when using a rule such as Created Timestamp Exists . Every user in Lytics will have a timestamp of when they were created. Therefore, the number of users who do not meet the condition of having a created timestamp will always be 0. Working With Rule Sets When building elaborate audiences, having a single set of rules that are evaluated using either an AND or an OR is not enough. A ruleset is a set of rules that itself can be used as a rule for an even larger set of rules that is again evaluated using an AND or an OR . This audience has two rulesets. The first ruleset has one rule: all users who have the characteristic Email Capture Status: Known Email . The second ruleset has two rules: all users have some affinity for Marketing OR Advertising content. Combining these two rulesets with the AND operator produces an audience that targets users with an email address that have some interest in either marketing or advertising. This audience could be used to email a special newsletter or promotion about a product or trending topic that is related to marketing or advertising. Excluding Rule Sets Rulesets, just like rules, can be excluded. Clicking the Include/Exclude toogle on the second ruleset will result in the audience targeting all users with an email address who do not have some interest in either marketing or advertising. It could be used to send a different email to the remainder of your users with email addresses. Building Audiences: Configuration Options Configure your Lytics audiences with the following options to execute your use cases. Enabling API Access By default, newly created Lytics audiences are not enabled for API access and thus will not be available to public APIs. Enabling API access is necessary when integrating with other client-side tags/ pixels, Pathfora , or the Lytics personalization API endpoints. Select the API Accessible checkbox to enable access. Generate Insights Lytics Insights provide visibility into the performance of your audiences and campaigns as users interact with your brand. Insights are generated out-of-the-box for Lytics Behavioral and Engagement audiences. You can also request up to 10 custom audiences to be prioritized as candidates for generating Insights. When creating a new audience or editing an existing one, select the Generate Insights checkbox to make that audience a candidate for Insights (shown in the screenshot above). Lytics prioritizes Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences for your account. Therefore, even if you select the \"Generate Insights\" option for a particular audience, it is not guaranteed to show up in your Insights drawer. Managing Audiences Managing audiences becomes important as an account develops and your user base grows. Audiences are critical to both targeted campaigns as well as discovering insights about your users. The Audiences section of Lytics houses all of your account’s audiences. You can view, create, and manage audiences from this section. Audiences are listed alphabetically by default. Click any column header to change the sort property. Common sort options are Last Modified and Size (the number of users in the audience). Naming Your Audiences For better targeting, Lytics encourages the creation of many audiences. They’re easy and free to make. When working with a large library of audiences, naming conventions become important. Name your audiences by purpose and include any categorization in the name. Giving them a common prefix (e.g., Holiday Promo: Tech lovers, Holiday Promo: Loyal Shoppers) will help you to keep everything related next to each other in the user interface. Audiences appear throughout the Lytics platform. Make sure your naming convention works in any context to avoid confusion. Finding Audiences The easiest way to find an audience is to use the Search box. As you enter your search term the audience list will display any matching audiences. 📘 Fuzzy matching is used to search for audiences so the results will not be an exact match to the search term. Editing Audiences Occasionally you will want to return to previously created audiences and update the logic used to create the segment. Find the audience you would like to edit Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the Edit button to enter the audience builder Make your desired changes within the audience builder Click Save 🚧 When editing audiences that are in an active triggered workflow, it is recommended that you reconfigure the job after the audience changes have been made. Duplicating Audiences Find the audience you would like to duplicate Click on the audience to navigate to the overview of the audience Click the ... button to enter the audience builder. The audience builder will be pre-populated with all of the criteria of the audience you duplicated. Make any desired changes Click Save 🚧 Audiences created by duplication will retain the name and slug of the duplicated audience, but with have \"duplicate\" appended at the end. It is recommended that you update both the name and manually input a unique slug name for clarity sake. Deleting Audiences Deleting audiences is an integral part to keeping a tidy workspace in Lytics. Audiences can be deleted in one of two ways: individually or in batch. Note: Deleting an audience does not delete the users associated with that audience. Deleting an Individual Audience From the Browse Audiences list, select the name of the audience you wish to delete. From the options menu, select Delete . Click Delete . Click Accept to confirm. Deleting Multiple Audiences From the Browse Audiences list, select the checkboxes of the audiences you wish to delete. NOTE: Audience selection persists when changing pages allowing you to select audiences from multiple pages. Click Delete Selected Audiences . Click Delete . NOTE: Lytics will check to see if the audiences you selected are safe to delete. Audiences are considered safe if they are not used in an ongoing export, campaign, or another audience's definition. You will be prompted to delete dependant audiences, click Yes to delete the selected audience and any dependants listed or Skip cancel deletion of the selected audience. Click Accept to confirm. Maintaining Audiences 📘 From the Audiences page, click any audience in the list to view all of its details. An audience's landing page contains a lot of valuable information about your users and the audience itself. At the top of the audience page, you will find the following information... Audience name ID Slug Created by Created on date Last updated date API access configuration Below this information you will find multiple tabs where you can access additional information about the audience. Audience Summary The audience summary page is designed to provide insights into the current state of an audience as well as how the audience has changed over time. When first navigating to an audience landing page, this tab will be selected by default. The Summary tab includes the following sections: General Metrics The total number of users in this audience The total percentage of this audience as compared to the total number of profiles in your account The percentage change in audience size over the last 7 and last 30 days Activity trend (graph of audience size over the defined date range) Activity Graph After creating a new audience, the audience size graph will begin to populate within a day. Depending on the date range you specify, the activity graph can be viewed using following intervals: Hourly Daily Weekly Monthly Audience Size Trends 📘 The statistics for audience size start from the creation date of the audience. Keep in mind that audiences are real-time. This makes them quite different from the user lists in other marketing tools which are frozen in time and only change when you update the list. Audiences are filters applied to the total audience and will change whenever a user's behavior changes in a way that will add or remove them from the audience definition. In this way, tracking audience size over time is a powerful reporting tool. For example, you create an audience that contains users who have visited the international news section of your website. Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched. This is clear evidence that the campaign was effective, and most effective in the first 24 hours, at driving users to your international news section.s Audience Details Select the Details tab to view the following sections: Exports : This section outlines what exports (if any) are using this audience Recent Users : This section allows you to view a sample of users in this audience who have been active recently (by clicking the View button) Audience Characteristics Select the Characteristics tab to view the characteristics of users in this audience. Characteristics include: Behavior Web Activity Content Affinity Campaign Referral Interactions Audience Logs Select the Logs tab to view recent events relating to this audience. Activity such as creation, updating and syncing can all be found here. Activating Audiences Activating Audiences in Experiences Creating a Lytics Experience is one of the easiest and most common ways to activate Lytics Audiences. Learn more about Lytics Experiences to find out how you can engage your audiences on site. Accessing Audiences Using the Public Entity API The Lytics Experience Editor is a great way to get started with website personalization, but through the use of the Lytics API, there is much more that can be done. The Lytics Experience editor is powered by the Pathfora SDK which is in turn powered by the Lytics Entity API. The Lytics Entity API is how to find out what audiences the current user belongs to as well as what traits the user has. Using the Lytics Entity API it's possible to create completely custom personalized experiences on your site. 📘 Personalizing a site using the Public Entity API requires making code changes to the host website. To read more about the Entity API, check out the API documentation . Exporting Audiences to Other Tools A core benefit of Lytics is exporting your smart audiences to the other tools in your marketing tech stack. That way, the campaigns run on your channels are enriched with the behavioral data and content affinities powered by data science on Lytics. From the audience overview page, click the Export button to create a new export job . The Export menu lists built in exports such as Email CSV and any out of the box Integrations.

    "title": "What is Vault?",
    "content": "What is Vault? Suggest Edits Introduction Vault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account. Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault. Navigating Vault Vault is comprised of the following sections: Account Usage - an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption. Account Settings - view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories. Account Details JavaScript Tag Lytics API Content Security Schema Users - view a list of users accessing your Lytics account, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account. Security Access Tokens - view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens. New tokens can be provisioned with specific permissions. Authorizations - create, edit, view, and delete authorizations within Lytics. Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run. Account Setup JavaScript Tag - learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation. Who can access Vault? Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available. 📘 If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions. In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under \"Manage My Profile.\" Notable Changes For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities. Product Switcher Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on. Account Usage Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault \"dashboard\" for admin users. Account Settings Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings. Users The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address. The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name. Access Tokens The access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles. Authorizations Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth. JavaScript Tag Installation This page remains unchanged, with simple styling changes and updated links to our documentation for troubleshooting.

    "content": "Chrome Extension Suggest Edits Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension Overview The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome extension is a comprehensive tool designed to simplify validation, debugging, and exploration of Lytics' client-side capabilities as facilitated by our core and personalization SDKs. With this extension, users can easily: Validate that Lytics is connected to your site. Debug and validate that the data collected by Lytics, be it automatic or custom, is behaving as expected. Explore the current visitor's full profile to validate: If the profile is available for personalization. The events collected are having the expected impact on attributes and segment membership. Explore \"Experiences\" currently active on your site and could be surfaced to visitors. Installation Install Now Install Extension: This extension is installed directly into your Chrome browser. To install, visit the primary extension page and follow the instructions. Pin Extension to Nav Bar: Once installed, we recommend pining the extension to your top bar for easy access. Getting Started Once the extension is installed, you can visit any website where Lytics is or should be installed and begin debugging. Enable the extension : To activate the Lytics Dev Tools extension, open the extension and toggle the slider at the top right of the extension to either \"Enable\" or \"Disable.\" Verify Installation: The extension will verify that the Lytics tag has been installed successfully before further debugging. This is confirmed by the \"Lytics JavaScript SDK Installed\" alert displayed on the dashboard of the extension. Navigation: Once enabled, you'll access three key sections: Debugger, Profile, and Personalization, each offering specific functionalities tailored to streamline your debugging and exploration process. Debugger The debugger section of the extension serves multiple purposes. Firstly, as we did previously, it allows you to validate installation, ensuring that the Lytics tag is successfully implemented. Additionally, it provides access to the full active configuration of the JavaScript SDK through the configuration tab. Moreover, it includes a live event debugger that monitors and displays comprehensive details of any calls made to the Lytics APIs in real time. This feature is particularly valuable for reviewing data sent via jstag.send calls, offering insights into the interaction between your website and Lytics APIs. Profile In the \"Profile\" section of the extension, users gain a live look at the current visitor's profile, providing valuable insights into their browsing behavior and demographic information. This section offers a snapshot of key details, such as the visitor's unique identifier and behavioral scores, allowing for a quick assessment of their engagement level. Additionally, users can access a detailed view of all information available to the browser, including demographic data, past interactions, and any custom attributes stored in the visitor's profile. This comprehensive overview enables users to tailor their strategies and personalize experiences based on individual visitors' specific characteristics and preferences. Personalization In the \"Personalization\" section of the extension, users gain access to a log of all active Lytics experiences and campaigns, along with their associated details. This feature proves invaluable when debugging the configuration of experiences or ensuring that overrides have produced the expected results. Users can easily track the performance and behavior of each personalized element on their website by providing a comprehensive overview of active campaigns and experiences, including their parameters and settings. This functionality streamlines debugging and empowers users to fine-tune their personalization strategies for optimal effectiveness.

    "content": "Adobe Suggest Edits Overview This guide offers an overview of options for leveraging Lytics standard integration capabilities to connect with Adobe’s ads products. The decisioning capabilities of Lytics can be combined with the personalized activation proficiency of the Adobe products: Adobe Campaign Adobe Analytics Adobe Target Adobe Ad Cloud Adobe Audience Manager Options for sending data from Lytics to Adobe: Sending file based data directly to Adobe using a Lytics File Servce Sending data in near real time from Lytics to one of our supported data warehouse integrations ( Google BigQuery , Microsoft Azure , Snowflake , Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift ). Then from the data warehouse, send the data to Adobe Cloud Client Side - Lytics surfaces data in Web Layer via the Lytics JavaScript Tag. Learn how you can via the Lytics tag here. Options for sending data from Adobe to Lytics: From Adobe send data to a Lytics Supported data warehouse  ( Google BigQuery , Microsoft Azure , Snowflake , Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift ). The data from the data warehouse can be imported into Lytics. In many cases this is the recommended approach to avoid duplication of processes and data storage. Sending file based data from Adobe to Lytics using a Lytics File Service Client Side - Using the Lytics JavaScript Tag [link] to pass Information to Lytics from the website / data layer Further details on integrating with Adobe products Adobe Campaign Lytics can export file based data to Adobe Campaign via hourly/daily CSV file export to an SFTP location. Adobe Campaign can import CSV files from its own secure location. This is more of a limitation on the Adobe Campaign side regarding limited API access. Adobe Analytics There are many ways to get data into Lytics from Adobe Analytics. One common method is to use the Lytics Javascript tag (jstag.send) function to send eVars directly from the data layer into Lytics on page load. This method will simplify the onboarding process and minimize the need to do a data transfer from Adobe Analytics on a regular basis. As part of onboarding, we can help identify which data you would like to pull in for activation and identify the right mechanisms for ingestion. Lytics provides ways to ingest this data from scheduled SFTP pickups to Bulk API imports or transactional APIs. Adobe Target Our Javascript Tag will communicate user audience membership to Adobe Target, which will respond with the appropriate site personalizations.  This Lytics data will be returned from our platform on page load and the Users Profile, segmentation information and content recommendations will be placed in the web page data layer. You can pass this information simply by leveraging the lio.data.segments object that is loaded onto every page where the Lytics JS tag is deployed. Adobe Ad Cloud Similar to other Adobe products, Adobe Ad Cloud supports the consumption of user audiences via SFTP, Json file upload, API (Lytics can create a webhook to stream data - but more conversation with Adobe will be needed) as well as direct from other Adobe products like Adobe Audience Manager. Lytics can also directly send audiences from Lytics into ad platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, LiveRamp.  With our Google partnership, Lytics has early access to Google’s API-based integration for custom audiences within DV360. Adobe Audience Manager We can deliver audiences into Audience Manager via SFTP or Data Warehouse integration, similar to how the above integrations have been documented.

    "title": "Identity Resolution",
    "content": "Identity Resolution Suggest Edits Introduction Identity Resolution is a crucial component of customer communication. Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance. Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels. The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components: Our Approach Define: Relationships Between Identifiers Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered: How important is accuracy? How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly? How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools? Construct: Complex Profiles Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact. Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity: What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all? What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity? Maintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented. Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers: How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time? What is the process for managing consent? How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated? What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies? Advanced Concepts The Lytics Identity Graph Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source. To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or more identity keys that identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called an identity fragment .  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser. Graph Mechanics As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment. However, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc. In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is called traversal .  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are called neighbors . In Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contact Lytics support . Identity Keys As we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution. For example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated with many email addresses. Field Types Field types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball. Using an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values. Identity Key Rankings The ranking of your identity keys should reflect their reliability and their relative importance in the strategy.  In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers. Imagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have a conflict , meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with two different email fragments and violates our merge rules. The ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A and not the profile for Email B. Graph Compaction We mentioned that a critical tenet of bulletproof identity resolution is that profile complexity remains stable over time.  That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts. In Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy. Compaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms. Rank-based Compaction Let's go back to our example with Email A and Email B.  The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time. Size compaction : Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size.  If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed. Time compaction : These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold.  If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be compacted into a single fragment.

    "content": "Lytics Integration Options Suggest Edits Lytics Integration Options If you don’t see your ads or marketing tool in our integrations list we offer the following options to connect with other platforms. With our Integration Options we enable flexibility across the various channels where your data exists and tools to build customized integrations. Lytics Integration Options include: Webhooks Lytics File Service integrations for server-to-server file transfer Javascript Tag Mobile SDK Data Warehouse Integrations Read on for details on each option. If you have questions about any of these options or would like to further explore an integration with a specific platform reach out to your Lytics contact. Webhooks Webhooks offer one of the simplest and most flexible options for enabling applications to share data. They’re broadly used in the cloud computing world for integrations that can be stood up quickly with a minimal amount of code. The Lytics Webhook integration supports triggered delivery of audience membership (enters and exits) to a destination url where another application can pick it up. See our Webhook documentation for full details. Interested to understand how a Webhook integration might be applied? Look at this Mobile Messaging use case for a simple Lytics Webhook integration to support one-to-one personalized messaging with Twilio. Server-to-Server File Transfer Server-to-server file transfer is a very common mechanism for data sharing. Lytics File Service options enable Lytics to pull or push user data from an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) using a CSV (comma-separated values) or JSON file. If you have another platform that also enables integrations via SFTP, this integration path helps to automate the process of passing data between your system and Lytics. Check out the Lytics File Service documentation to learn about setting up the file transfer job. In addition to SFTP, Amazon S3 is a very commonly used medium for server-to-server file transfer. Refer to our Amazon S3 documentation for data import and export options. Javascript Layer/JS Tag The Lytics JS Tag is the default option for client-side (website) data sharing with Lytics. The JS Tag supports the delivery of user behavior attributes from your website into Lytics and can also return back to the website user profile data such as audience members or content recommendations from Lytics for real time personalization. Refer to our JS Tag Documentation for full details. Mobile SDK The Lytics Mobile SDK facilitates in-app data sharing with iOS and Android. Similar to the JS Tag, the Mobile SDK supports user behavior-based data delivery to Lytics and profile data to the app for real-time personalization. See our Mobile SDK Documentation for more details. Using Your Data Warehouse If you already use a data warehouse to manage your data this is a great option for data import and export with Lytics. Lytics integrates with Google Big Query Amazon Redshift Microsoft Azure Snowflake Databricks Each of these providers offers options for importing data into databases which can then be imported into Lytics using Cloud Connect or our Data Import integrations. Lytics can also export data into each of these data warehouses.

Please note, that this is not an exhaustive list of scenarios, the following should be considered a guideline. Community - Lytics has a community section on their docs site where users of Lytics can ask general questions about Lytics, how to use Lytics, and what’s possible with Lytics. Think of this community area as your Lytics Stackoverflow. The Lytics Community can be found here. Some examples of community-type questions are: “Regarding the NLP engine, are you able to scrape all the contents of, apply topics to, and associate topic scores to users on PDFs?” “Can one set up alerts for jobs failing and/or being deleted like you can set up alerts for event overages?” “Is there an endpoint I can hit to see hidden streams?” Customer-specific questions or questions that regard Solution Architecture (complex) for a customer are not suitable for the Community section and should be asked in Zendesk. Zendesk - All customers and partners working on behalf of customers can use the Lytics Support Portal for the following: Report technical issues with the Lytics platform, e.g. Bug reports Feature Requests Solution architecture questions that require discretion with customer needs Assistance with features that may not be accessible by a partner or customer Partners can contact the Lytics support team through support.lytics.com or [email protected] , which will create a Zendesk ticket. Slack & Email - Partners are encouraged to communicate directly with the Lytics team for other partnership needs. Please prioritize Community and Zendesk for any customer CDP-related questions. Some examples of Email and Slack communications are: Contract questions, billing invoices, or other administrative needs Partnership questions Lytics Training Customer status check-ins Meeting coordination Customer-specific issues that are not appropriate in the Lytics public Community forum Updated 3 months ago",

    "title": "Importing External Experiences",
    "content": "Importing External Experiences Suggest Edits Importing External Experiences You can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences. While you can monitor Experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. If you want to stop, delete, or edit the execution of an Experience, you need to do so within the provider. If you choose to delete an Experience in Lytics that still has a matching campaign in your channel tool, it will show up on the import list and can be re-imported. Centralize cross-channel reporting Lytics serves as a central hub to monitor your cross-channel marketing, making it easier to understand and improve the performance of  your campaigns. For example, instead of logging into Facebook to check your ad campaign metrics and Iterable to check your email newsletter open rates, you can monitor the performance of both tools within your Lytics dashboard. To start monitoring external Experiences on Lytics, follow the batch import steps. Monitor Experiences via batch import On your Lytics dashboard, navigate to Experiences , and select Add Experiences > Import . Select your provider The Lytics Canvas connects out-of-the-box with select channel providers. Over time, more providers will be added to this list. If you want to use a provider that is not currently available, you can use the \"Generic Experience\" workflow to export Lytics audiences to any of your integrated providers. Authorize Next, you will be prompted to select an authorization for your chosen provider. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel such as Facebook, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. For Facebook, there is a second step for authorizing Ad Set ID after you’ve selected your account ID. Import Experiences Finally, select the Experiences you want to import into Lytics (up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to your use cases. Completed experiences, such as an Ad Set that previously \"ended\", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. But if you have Ad Sets in Facebook that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import. Connect Experiences with Lytics audiences Once you start monitoring external Experiences, you can activate them by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences, content affinities, and delivery optimization. An example use case is to conserve Facebook ad spend by only targeting “Currently Engaged” users who have a high affinity for the content of a particular campaign. Leveraging data science under the hood, Lytics audiences can bring immediate value to your existing marketing campaigns. If you have already imported an external Experience, you can activate it from the Experience summary view by clicking Edit in the top right. If you want to activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, follow the single import steps below, which will guide you through the Experience editor. Activate Experiences via single import To activate an Experience that you haven't imported yet, you will follow the workflow of creating a new Experience in Lytics. From the Experiences list view, click Add Experiences > New . Select your chosen provider and then Import the campaign, ad set, or journey. This example will continue with importing a SendGrid campaign. Next you will select an Authorization for your chosen provider as described above. Then you will select the campaign or ad set to import. Note that here you can only import one Experience at a time. Click Import 1 Experience to continue. Complete the Experience Editor steps Finally, you will complete the following Experience Editor steps: Target: configure your target audience for this Experience. Configure provider: choose how the audience for your Experience will be exported to the third-party tool. Configure delivery: option to automatically determine when to deliver messages to individual users on the third-party tool. Upon completion, your Experience will be ready to publish.

    "content": "Connecting Warehouses Suggest Edits Access Cloud Connect tabs are found under Data Pipeline > Cloud Connect . Connections configure the access to your data warehouses, and Data Models configure the SQL queries that are run to connect audience membership and profile attributes. Creating a Connection Click + Create New Connection from the Connections Dashboard at the top right and complete the following steps. Choose the provider. Choose the Connection type. Select an existing Authorization or create a new one by following the Authorization instructions . Add a name (label), description, and complete the configuration options. These will vary slightly between providers. Authorization & Security The authorization selected for your Connection will control your Lytics account users' access to your data warehouse. You can control whether a user has read access to the entire dataset or individual tables, maintaining your security and governance practices within your data warehouse. Supported Data Warehouses Cloud Connect currently supports a number of popular data warehouses: Amazon Redshift Databricks Google BigQuery Microsoft Azure SQL Database Snowflake Managing Connections Once you have created a Connection, you can access a summary page showing how data from your data warehouse is being leveraged in Lytics. At the top of the page, you’ll see the following information: Provider : Data warehouse that you are connecting with Lytics. Authorization : Name of the authorization, such as “Cloud Connect JWT.” Note: Lytics users can access any data tables that the Connection Authorization has read access to. Type : Indicates the type based on your provider. Created By : Lytics user who created the Connection. Created On : Date the Connection was initially created. Last Updated : Date the Connection was most recently edited. The rest of the Summary tab shows how many active and inactive data models are built using this Connection as a data source and how many tables are accessible from this dataset. The Activity chart displays how many rows are being queried, which can have cost implications based on your data warehouse usage. Explore The Explore tab provides a simple Schema Explorer to validate that the data shown is as you would expect to see in your data warehouse. In the example below, we only connected an individual table, but here you will see as many tables as the authorization has read access to. Details The Details section displays all the information about setting up your Connection, including the authorization and configuration settings. Logs The Logs section records the history of events for this Connection, which are helpful to ensure your connection is working as expected. Below are the connection event types you may see. Connection Events Description Created First event indicating the Connection is active. Updated Connection was updated by a Lytics user. Deleted Connection was removed and any data models built on this Connection will no longer be updated.

    "content": "Client & Server Side Cookies Everything you wanted to know about cookies from client side to server side. Suggest Edits What is a Cookie An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. Cookie Flavors First-party First-party cookies are created by the host domain – the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences. Third-party Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats. Common Cookie Use Cases Session management Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember. Personalization User preferences, themes, and other settings. Tracking Recording and analyzing user behavior. How does Lytics use cookies? Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our _uid or, in some cases seerid as a first-party cookie. Creating & Managing Cookies Where do cookies come from? Client-Side In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser. When someone refers to a “client-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript. Server Side Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications. When someone refers to a “server-side cookie,” they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc. Cookie Ingredients Name Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes. Value The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash. Expires Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. See Date for the required formatting. Max-Age Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately. Domain Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent. Path Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the Cookie header. Secure This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the HTTPS: scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks . HttpOnly Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through the Document.cookie property. Note that a cookie created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch() . This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting ( XSS ). SameSite Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks ( CSRF ). Who’s taking away my cookies?!? In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) . This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably: ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1) ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0) ITP caps all first-party cookies set with JavaScript to 7 days or 24 hours. (ITP 2.1/2.2) ITP caps first-party cookies set by the server using CNAME cloaking to 7 days. (ITP 2.3) As a result of the privacy and security efforts in general other browsers such as Mozilla’s Firefox(ETP) and Google Chrome have followed suit in announcing and/or implementing their security and tracking protocols, which continue to impact tools such as third and first-party cookies that have long been a staple in providing the data necessary for marketers to personalize their communications effectively. What can I do to replace my cookies? With each iteration on more stringent privacy-related changes comes a wave of workarounds or alternate approaches to maintaining access to behavioral data essential to marketing: 1. Deploy a strong first-party identification strategy. There is no replacement then a strong identification strategy. Creating a relationship in which a user will openly share their identity through a login or some other authenticated means will always result in the highest level of certainty on identity, which leads to the best level of personalization. However, many use cases focus on anonymous users or users who have not built up the relationship necessary to unlock this level of authentication. 2. First-party client-side cookies have changed but are still a viable solution. Though third-party cookies are effectively dead, first-party cookies are still viable for many use cases. Not only do they offer a very simple off-the-shelf type of implementation for leveraging, they also have a long shelf life, assuming that an anonymous user interacts frequently enough to overcome the 7-day expiration window. 3. First-party server-side cookies offer an extended expiration window. Over the past 12 months, there has been a surge of interest in server-side cookies. This method for setting cookies currently is not affected by the ITP changes that impact client-side cookies, most notably the automatic expiration at seven days. Rather, server-side cookies can live for long periods, leading to a higher quality identification for anonymous users. The downside, however, is they are far more difficult to leverage than the client-side. They require a much more technical integration with whatever server-side technology is used to power the web asset and may not be accessible in the same manner as client-side cookies. Getting Technical with Server Side Cookies In general, regardless of the specific attribute settings used when leveraging server-side cookies, they currently are not impacted by the 7-day expiration window that client-side cookies fall victim to. However, Apple has made it clear that they have additional plans to extend some of the client-side cookie limitations to the server-side, and the most important attribute in that discussion is the HttpOnly attribute. https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/ As a CDP and technology leader, we always aim to help our customers future-proof their implementations. As such, even though a non-HttpOnly server-side cookie offers an easier means to bypass current client-side restrictions, it is our recommendation to consider investing to leverage HttpOnly cookies set by the server-side to prevent any potential impacts of the next few iterations of ITP. Below we’ll explore the two options and demonstrate the key differences. Server Side Cookie without HttpOnly The following example in Node.js demonstrates a sample snippet for setting the cookie server side. Most server-side languages have existing methods to make this very easy. In the case of creating a cookie for Lytics to leverage, you will also need to generate a unique ID which can be done in a variety of ways. In the case of Node, you may consider using the randomUUID() method of the Crypto interface . A simple Google search can lead you or your developer down the road of generating a unique ID that best fits your use case. Once you have that unique ID, you simply set the cookie using the pre-defined Lytics name our Javascript tag is looking for. Alternatively, the tag can be configured to use any custom name. // THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL\n// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND\n// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar dayjs = require('dayjs');\n\n// cookieParser middleware\napp.use(cookieParser());\n\n// route for setting the cookies\napp.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {\n  // setting a server side cookie without httponly\n  res.cookie(\"seerid\", crypto.randomUUID(), {\n    httpOnly: false,\n    expires: dayjs().add(30, \"days\").toDate(),\n  });\n\n  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set.</p></body></html>`);\n})\n\n// Route for getting all the cookies\napp.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {\n    res.send(`\n        <html>\n            <head>\n                <script>\n                    alert(document.cookie);\n                </script>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side.</p>\n            </body>\n        </html>`\n    );\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('server running on port 3000');\n}); Since non-HttpOnly cookies are accessible out of the box client-side there is no additional lift necessary. Our tag will pick up the cookie and use that ID as the identifier. It is important to note that any UID changes must also be managed server-side as setting the cookie client-side will engage the 7-day expiration max. In this example, we simply raise an alert with the cookie string and do not show the actual implementation of the Lytics tag. Server Side Cookie with HttpOnly Setting HttpOnly to true comes with an additional level of complexity but benefits from following the stringent and recommended guidelines of Apple ITP, which in theory will go farther in the way of future-proofing. Much like the above example, we’ll set a cookie, in this case using Node, in the same way. The only difference here is setting httpOnly to true. This means that the cookie is secure but will no longer be accessible out of the box by Javascript. Rather, you’ll have to implement an alternative method for surfacing that ID to Javascript so that it can be passed to the Lytics Javascript tag and used during collection/resolution. // THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A UNTESTED AND NON-PRODUCTION LEVEL\n// EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SET A COOKIE SERVER SIDE WITH NODE.JS AND\n// ACCESS THE DOCUMENT.COOKIES FROM THE CLIENT SIDE WHEN USING HTTPONLY\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar dayjs = require('dayjs');\n\n// cookieParser middleware\napp.use(cookieParser());\n\n// route for setting the cookies\napp.get('/setcookie', function (req, res) {\n  // setting a server side cookie with httponly\n  res.cookie(\"uuid\", crypto.randomUUID(), {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    expires: dayjs().add(30, \"days\").toDate(),\n  });\n\n  res.send(`<html><body><p>A server side cookie has been set using httpOnly.</p></body></html>`);\n})\n\n// Route for getting all the cookies\napp.get('/getcookie', function (req, res) {\n    res.send(`\n        <html>\n            <head>\n                <script>\n                    var uuid = '${req.cookies.uuid}';\n                    alert(uuid);\n                </script>\n            </head>\n            <body>\n                <p>This is an example of how to get the cookies client side when cookie is httpOnly.</p>\n            </body>\n        </html>`\n    );\n})\n\napp.listen(3000, (err) => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('server running on port 3000');\n}); All code examples in this document are purely for demonstration. Any customer facing implementation should follow the guidance of our customer facing technical teams and the technical experts on our customer’s end. These examples in production represent HIGH risk as documented. Updated about 1 year ago Table of Contents What is a Cookie Cookie Flavors Common Cookie Use Cases How does Lytics use cookies?

    "title": "IDP-initiated SSO (legacy)",
    "content": "IDP-initiated SSO (legacy) Suggest Edits IDP-initiated SSO (Legacy) 🚧 This document describes a legacy implementation that Lytics is actively deprecating. If you're looking for details on the current SSO implementation, check out the new documentation. Lytics supports enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) by using Auth0 as a service provider using SAML protocol . Lytics integrates with Identity Providers (IdPs) in such a way that the IdP initiates SSO. That is, when your end user logs in to their IdP, they will use a global portal for your organization. Users can then click a link or button that will log them into Lytics seamlessly. Behind the scenes, the IdP will be contacting the Lytics Auth0 service provider to verify the user and redirect them to a logged-in instance of the Lytics app. This document describes the process for integrating with a new IdP that uses SAML. Service Provider Configuration To configure SAML for the Lytics service provider some information is required about your IdP. If you have a metadata file that contains SAML provider information this may be appropriate, just make sure that the following information is provided to Lytics Support : Sign In URL X509 Signing Certificate (The identity provider public key - if possible encoded in a separate PEM or CER formatted file) Sign Out URL Further configuration details such as mappings may need to be provided. Once this information has been received, Lytics can configure the SAML connection in Auth0. IdP Configuration After Lytics configures the SAML connection on the service provider, Lytics Support will provide a metadata XML file with the following information in order to complete the IdP configuration. The key fields in this metadata are: Connection Name Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (aka post-back or callback URL) Entity ID of the Service Provider With this information, your IdP connection can be configured to complete the SSO integration. Testing SSO Once all the information has been configured in both the IdP and the Lytics service provider, you can test and verify that the SSO implementation works as expected. If you are using SSO as your only sign-in method, please disable any password restriction or expiration settings that may have been enabled in the UI. During the testing process, Lytics can be configured to allow both SSO logins and regular username and password (or Google OAuth) login through the app. This allows users to test SSO without disrupting the day-to-day usage of the app. If requested, once the SSO implementation has been tested and verified, Lytics can disable the use of other logins for an account. Troubleshooting SSO If it's known that SSO is going to be added to an account, then the user email addresses added to the account should match the email address present within the IdP. If the email address doesn’t match, then the login will fail as Lytics will not be able to verify that there is a user with that email address. For instance, if the email listed in the IdP is abc@123 , and within Lytics it’s def@456 , then the user will have successfully been verified by their IdP, but the login within Lytics would fail as the authenticated user email would not match the user within Lytics. You would need to create a new user within Lytics with the email address abc@123 for the SSO login to be successful. It should also be noted that primary accounts are decided as the first account that a user was added to.  Due to this,  users from a single group/organization will often have different primary accounts. This is important for SSO as it will also be the account that the user is logged into at the start of their session. If SSO is enabled as the only means of login on one account and a user attempts to log-in using Google OAuth or their username and password, the login session will fail. The following options are possible solutions: Add that user to your IdP. Other methods of logging in would need to be added (Google OAuth, username/password). Remove user from all accounts and then add them back with the first account being the account that you want to be their primary account. Lytics Support can assist in the troubleshooting process. When testing for the first time Lytics can enable logging to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. If you are receiving the error message shown below after being redirected to the app, that means there is an issue on the application side. The Lytics Support team can help debug this if you provide information on the login attempt such as the time of the login and the user and account. If you’re encountering an error earlier in the login process, such as before you are redirected to the Lytics app, this may be an issue with the SAML configuration either on the IdP or Service provider side. Lytics’ support team can review these issues and coordinate a fix, just contact us with the details of the issue.

    "title": "Insights",
    "content": "Insights Suggest Edits Introduction Lytics Insights provide visibility into how your audiences and campaigns perform and recommend how you may improve engagement, drive conversions, and increase marketing ROI. You can think of Lytics Insights as a way to connect the data you have with the decisions you are making for marketing campaigns. Defined in a few words, Lytics Insights are: Actionable : Direct knowledge to your marketing initiatives. Contextual : Provide actions that are relevant to the Lytics user consuming them. Explanatory : Describe phenomena in terms of your business processes or outcomes. Novel : Offer a new understanding of your customers and campaigns. Insights serve as a key ingredient to achieve marketing personalization. To effectively leverage customer data, you must apply it throughout your campaign planning and execution process. Unlike metrics that remain on a BI dashboard or report, Lytics Insights are designed be immediately activated in your segmentation and campaign strategies. If your account package includes Insights, you can access Insights from anywhere in the Lytics UI. How Insights Work Insights surface meaningful data and recommended action, enabling you to make better, data-driven decisions during your campaign planning and execution. The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions: Fact : Observable, data-driven information providing demonstrable value. This is a unique set of raw metrics, such as the number of users or the amount of lift. Action : Suggested behavior based on user role, data source, activation channels, industry, etc. This is the contextualization of a fact into something to be done. Insights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood. This is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook. Insight Cards Insights are presented as Insight Cards that are available throughout the entire app. Simply navigate to the left-hand side of the Lytics UI to open the Insights Drawer , which contains a list of Insight Cards unique to your account. Below is an example of an Insight card and what it's comprised of: Creation date : When the Insight was generated. Expiration date : When the Insight will be removed from the drawer. Insights expire after 2 weeks. Insight statement : The explanation or comparison of noteworthy data will depend on the type of Insight. You can click on an audience name to view its summary report. Recommended action : Lytics will suggest how you can apply this Insight to your targeting along with a related use case. Expanded definition : View more details by clicking the arrow. This example explains the Lytics score or other data field being calculated. Insights are generated and refreshed on a weekly basis to ensure you are viewing the most recent user data. Insights expire after 2 weeks, so you only target and activate an audience and campaigns during a relevant time frame. The Insights Drawer will display a maximum of 25 cards at a time. Insights will be created for up to 10 custom audiences , in addition to Lytic's out-of-the-box engagement audiences. Lytics will prioritize Insights based on the statistical significance of the data and the most frequently used audiences. Compositional Insights Compositional Insights help you understand the makeup of your audiences. This information can answer, “what makes an audience unique?” and “How should I target these users differently?” Compositional Insights make it easier for you to create effective segmentation strategies. They compare data fields within audiences to surface which attributes drive user behavior. Compositional Insights currently include the following: Audience Pairs This Insight compares high-value audiences on their levels of engagement. This can take the form of comparing Lytic's out-of-the-box audiences on a particular behavioral score or a custom audience. As a bite-size piece of information, this Insight Card has provided: An easy way to leverage Lytics audiences and scores that are derived from data science. A suggested next step of what to do with this information. For example, you may target these at-risk users with a win-back campaign. Field Candidates This Insight compares the prevalence of specific data fields within two audiences. Candidates included are fields used in audience definitions and fields from the Promoted Schema Fields in your Account Settings . Having a granular understanding of your audiences allows you to make more strategic targeting decisions. For example, there may be a data field that your organization is paying to collect. If you discover through an Insight Card that this field is not performing as expected in your campaigns, you could save marketing spend by eliminating that field and using others that are shown to be more predictive of user behavior. Experience Insights Experience Insights help you track and understand campaign performance. This information can answer, “Which campaigns are resonating with my users?” and “Are my marketing tactics driving engagement or conversions?” Experience Insights allow you to refine campaigns based on current metrics proactively. Since Lytics Insights are generated and refreshed every week, you can take action to improve a campaign while it’s running. Experience Insights include the following types: Experience Management This Insight will surface when an experience is missing UTM parameters, which enable Lytics to track conversions from downstream tools such as Facebook. While this Insight is more straightforward than the other types Lytics offers, it helps you quickly identify when an Experience configuration is incomplete, affecting your ability to track performance and target users who have previously engaged in future campaigns. Experience Performance This Insight appears when a significant spike up or down in campaign performance exists. Awareness of such incidents allows you to make the necessary changes to improve campaign ROI. For example, if conversion rates have rapidly declined for a particular campaign in the last week, you may need to reevaluate and consider changes such as refining your audience, messaging, or campaign tactics. Activating Insights Taking action based on your Insights is the most important part of the process. As the introduction explains, Lytics Insights are designed to be actionable. By understanding how users interact with your brand at a granular level, you can iterate campaigns to improve their performance and deliver better user experiences. Activating against Lytics Behavioral Scores User engagement is a crucial component of personalization. Each Lytics Score (quantity, frequency, recency, intensity, momentum, propensity) indicates a different aspect of user behavior,  but overall, higher scores indicate high engagement, while lower scores indicate low engagement. Below are some everyday use cases you might consider, depending on whether the target audience has higher behavioral scores (anything above 50) or lower behavioral scores (anything below 50). Targeting Users with Low Engagement There are two main approaches to reaching unengaged users. The first is to drive engagement using a variety of tactics, such as messaging on different channels, targeting based on content affinities, etc. The second approach is to increase marketing efficiency by suppressing these users, thus improving your conversions. Targeting Users with High Engagement When creating strategies around your most active users, you will want to keep them engaged by delivering relevant content and establishing a first-party relationship that increases their Lifetime Value (LTV). You can find more users who are similar to your best customers using lookalike audiences. You can also learn more about what makes these engaged users different, which can inform your overall targeting strategies. View the Audience summary by clicking the audience name on your Insight Card to see the history of this audience and its characteristics. Activating against Lytics Content Affinity Giving your users more of what they love is a great tactic to consider to either drive engagement for less active users or to keep currently active users engaged.

    "title": "User Profiles",
    "content": "User Profiles Suggest Edits Introduction User profiles provide relevant insights about individual customers in relation to your entire customer base. Referencing a user profile helps answer questions about who your customers are and how they are engaging with your brand. Initially, the user profile offers a way to test your Lytics implementation and validate the outcomes of your marketing tactics. For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated. As you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity. To provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs: Intelligence , Audiences , and Details . Anatomy of a User Profile Intelligence The intelligence tab gives a snapshot of key information about an individual user. At the top, a bar is displayed to help you quickly understand user engagement across all channels: Likelihood to re-engage , Current engagement level , and Frequency of user interactions . Each of these boxes summarizes the data science-powered behavioral scores into practical terms. The individual behavior scores and the user’s content affinity are displayed below. This rich data based on a user’s actual behavior is available thanks to the predictive analytics built into Lytics. Recent activity by channel This module gives an overview of which channels (email, web, mobile, etc.) an individual user has been active in. When appropriately mapped, it will also provide information on when users were active on each channel (within the last day or within the last 30 days). NOTE : If this module is empty, please see below for details on how to configure the user fields. As with all data mapping exercises, it is best to include your Customer Success representatives for optimal results. How the recent activity by channel is managed If you are customizing LQL or handling custom streams, it is important to understand how this module should be configured. For all our built-in integrations, Lytics includes this data mapping by default. At its core, the \"Recent activity by channel\" module is built from a single user field. This field will not exist in legacy accounts and must be added to the existing LQL manually. For all new accounts that get the latest default LQL files, the baseline should be included. In order to handle either custom data mapping for an account or backfill an old account, the user field last_channel_activities must be defined in a streams LQL file. This field is defined as a map[string]time and should not be altered. In each stream you'll simply map a string, such as \"web\" or \"email\" to a timestamp such as epochms() in order to update the field. A more lengthy example for an email LQL might look something like: -- Profile Support\nmap(\"email\", epochms())    AS last_channel_activities    IF eq(tolower(action), \"open\") OR eq(tolower(action), \"click\")    SHORTDESC \"Last Activity By Channel\"    KIND map[string]time The example above is for when you only want to map the activity event in the case of a click or open. This definition will vary from stream to stream. When it comes to which keys to use, we recommend following these standards for common channels: email ad web mobile support Unique identifiers Highlights the identifiers that have been used to materialize this particular user's profile. Event chart The event chart shows a user’s activity by hour and day of the week. The top right of the chart highlights when a user is most active, for example Tuesdays at 10am. Audience Membership This tab displays a list of all the current Audiences a user belongs to and the total size of each audience. Audiences include factual information such as “Has Email Address” and “Known Location” along with Lytics score-driven characteristics such as “Deeply Engaged” or “Binge User”. Profile Details The details tab gives an under-the-hood display of the exact user fields contributing to a user’s behavioral data and their audiences. Unique identifiers are shown first, which are essential for enabling cross-channel mapping. For all user fields, the associated stream and value is provided. Profile Picture Some profiles may include a profile picture when viewed in the user interface. This image comes from Gravatar . If the profile in question has an email address, Lytics converts it to an MD5 hash. That hash is then used to look up the corresponding image on Gravatar. This image is only displayed in the Lytics UI and is not part of the profile itself.

Merge statistics in Lytics provide a way to monitor and optimize the merging process, ensuring that the data is adequately combined and reflects the most up-to-date and accurate information. In the example below, you can see how merge stats can be used to uncover potential areas of issue. Out of the four available identifiers, user_id, is not responsible for any merges. This could be due to several reasons, such as no data populating that field, the relationship being defined inaccurately, etc. Updated over 1 year ago",

    "title": "Data Models & Queries",
    "content": "Data Models & Queries Suggest Edits Cloud Connect Data Models A Data Model is used by Cloud Connect to link or \"connect\" a user's external data warehouse to Lytics profiles. Each Data Model represents a set of records defined by a SQL query. Each Data Model will also configure a join key which defines how the Data Model is joined to Lytics Profiles. Once a Connection to your data warehouse has been created, Data Models can be created via the Data Models tab within the navigation bar: Creating a Data Model Click + Create New from the Data Models dashboard and complete the following steps. Select the Connection. Write the SQL query. Query Editor : Write and test standard SQL queries directly in Lytics. Alternatively, copy and paste queries you've tested in your BigQuery or Snowflake instance. When you click Test Query , Lytics will return 10 sample records. Test the query and validate the results. Configure the Data Model. Name : Data Model name Description : The Description of the Data Model. Slug : The Data Model name that will be used in the membership and activation fields in the audience builder. It is important that the name chosen here makes sense for those building audiences in the tool. If no slug is selected, it will auto-populate using the model name. Primary Key : Select the data warehouse ID that will be used to match against profiles in Lytics. External Lytics Key : Select a Lytics user profile field that is a unique identifier to map to an identifier in your incoming data source. Activated Fields :Select the fields you want to bring into Lytics profiles for activation. Note that each data model can only include 25 columns as activated fields. Sync Frequency : Select a time interval to run the query on - this is also the frequency that your Lytics profiles will be updated. The beta options are currently every 1 hour to every 3 weeks. Create new Lytics profile : Check this box if you want to create new profiles in Lytics if a profile with a matching ID does not already exist in Lytics. If you do not select this check box, only users with matching IDs to the Data Model IDs will be updated. Activate the Model. Until the Data Model is activated, its SQL query will not be run against your data warehouse and Lytics profiles will not be updated with the selected fields. 📘 When building multiple Cloud Connect Data Models with the same primary key, you must select the same External Lytics Key mapping. Selecting a different Lytics key will result in an error when you try to save the new Data Model. Example Use Case Consider this scenario to demonstrate why you'd want to create a Cloud Connect Data Model driven audience instead of a standard Lytics audience. Your company sells e-bikes and wants to run a holiday campaign that sends a promotion to any customer who purchased an e-bike in November or December last year. Perhaps you also want to refine your audience to those who are interested in particular bike brands. All of this purchase and product data already exists in your Google BigQuery instance (as shown below). Instead of directly importing all that purchase history data into Lytics, you can write a SQL query to find which customers meet this audience criteria. By copying this query directly into the Lytics Model Builder (as shown in the generate a query screenshot above), you'll create a new audience in Lytics that will be updated on the frequency interval you decide. Once the Data Model is activated, profiles will be updated with a membership field that can be used to create an audience. Activated fields can be added to the Data Model that can then be used for more dynamic audiences. SQL Translator If you would like to skip having to write a SQL query, simply describe the Data Model of what you wish to fetch and using GenAI, Lytics will translate the description to a SQL query for you. Lytics makes queries to your database to ensure that the data is up to date and accurate when creating the query.

(Optional) In the Single Audience File Empty String text field, specify this to a value like \"null\" to represent an empty audience. Otherwise, an empty string is sent by default. Check the Keep Updated checkbox to continuously export users as they enter the audience. From the Time of Day dropdown, select a time of day to complete export each day. Export will sync every hour if left empty. From the Timezone dropdown, select the timezone for time of day specified above. Click Start Export . Export Audiences to Relational Tables Send Lytics user profile data and audience membership to your Acoustic Relational tables.  All existing and new users of the selected audience are exported in real-time. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : API Integration , Audience Trigger Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : Lytics users are exported to Acoustic Relational Table . This integration utilizes the Acoustic Relational Table Management api to export user data from Lytics to the Acoustic Relational Table. Once the export is started, the job: Creates or writes to the following tables depending on the configuration of the job (see the example below for a visual example), User table - the user identifier plus all scalar fields will be written to this table. Audience table - the user identifier plus a boolean (Yes/No) column for each Lytics audience exported. Users that belong to the audience will have true as value in the respective audience column, and similarly, will have false if the user does not belong to the audience. Non-scalar tables - for each non-scalar field exported a separate table will be created. For sets, the table will have a column for the user identifier plus a column called lytics_value with a row written for each value in the set. For maps, the table will have a column for the user identifier plus two columns, lytics_key and lytics_value with a row written for each key/value pair in the map. As users enter or exit the audience, rows will added or updated in the tables above The updates will be sent to Acoustic every 5 minutes or a batch of 1000 users, whichever occurs first. Fields You can export any Lytics user fields to Acoustic Relational Table. Lytics allows you to map user fields with the corresponding table columns as part of job configuration. The job also has option to create column in Acoustic table for Lytics user field. Configuration Follow these steps to set up an Export Audiences job for Acoustic. Select Acoustic from the list of providers. Select the Export Audience to Acoustic Relational Table job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. Using the Audiences list, select the Lytics audiences to export. As users enter or exit the selected audience(s) their record will be sent to Acoustic. From the Acoustic User Table dropdown, select the Acoustic relational table to populate with user profile data. Select Create New Table to create new user table with name lytics_user_table_{timestamp} . {timestamp} is replaced with current timestamp in format YYYYMMDDHHmmss . If Create New Table is selected, from the User Table Key Field dropdown, select the Lytics user field to be used as primary key for new user table. Should be left blank if writing to an existing table. If writing to an existing table, from the Acoustic User Table Mapping , map Lytics user fields that you would like to send from Lytics to corresponding Acoustic field. NOTE: All the key column for the selected Acoustic user table must be mapped. For either exporting to a new table or writing an existing table, from the Extra Fields list, select the additional Lytics user fields to export. These are extra scalar fields to be sent to Acoustic user table. Each field will be added as a separate column in the table. From the Acoustic Audience Membership Table dropdown, either select the Acoustic relational table to populate with audience information or select Create New Table . If the creation of a new audience table is selected, a table will be created with the name lytics_audiences_table_{timestamp} . {timestamp} is replaced with current timestamp in format YYYYMMDDHHmmss . If Create New Table is selected for the Acoustic audience membership table, in the Audience Membership Table Key Field dropdown, select the Lytics user field to be used as primary key for new audience membership table. Should be left blank if writing to an existing table. If writing to an existing audience table, from the Acoustic Audience Membership Table Key Mapping , map the keys from Lytics to the key columns in Acoustic. The primary key in Acoustic must be mapped. Using the Non-Scalar User Fields list, select any Lytics non-scalar user field to export. An Acoustic relational table with name lytics_{field-name}_table_{timestamp} will be created for each selected non-scalar field. If exporting non-scalar fields, from the Non-Scalar Field Table Key Field dropdown, select Lytics user field to be used as primary key for all new non-scalar field table. Select Existing Users to send users currently in the Lytics audience to Acoustic. Click Complete to create the job. Example Below is an example of a user exported and how they may look in Acoustic.

    "title": "Accessing Profiles Client Side",
    "content": "Accessing Profiles Client Side Suggest Edits Accessing Data from JavaScript Tag Once user fields have been surfaced, they can be used to personalize a user's experience. For example, a theoretical car buying site has surfaced some basic info about a user's last vehicle search results in the following data available in the browser. JSON {\n  \"last_make\": \"audi\",\n  \"last_model\": \"rx8\",\n  \"last_color\": \"onyx\",\n  \"segments\": [\n    \"all\",\n    \"potential_buyers\",\n    \"high_momentum\"\n  ]\n} Populate a Form Create a JavaScript function that populates form fields. JavaScript function(data){\n  if(data.last_make !== \"\"){\n    $('input[name=\"make\"]').val(data.last_make);\n  }\n\n  if(data.last_model !== \"\"){\n    $('input[name=\"model\"]').val(data.last_model);\n  }\n\n  if(data.last_color !== \"\"){\n    $('input[name=\"color\"]').val(data.last_color);\n  }\n} Initialize the callback handler. HTML <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n</script>!function(l,a){a.liosetup=a.liosetup||{},a.liosetup.callback=a.liosetup.callback||[],a.liosetup.addEntityLoadedCallback=function(l,o){if(\"function\"==typeof a.liosetup.callback){var i=[];i.push(a.liosetup.callback),a.liosetup.callback=i}a.lio&&a.lio.loaded?l(a.lio.data):o?a.liosetup.callback.unshift(l):a.liosetup.callback.push(l)}}(document,window); Create a callback: This will execute an action via JavaScript once the visitor has been identified and the profile has been loaded (using the function outlined above). HTML <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    window.liosetup.addEntityLoadedCallback(function(data){\n      if(data.last_make !== \"\"){\n        $('input[name=\"make\"]').val(data.last_make);\n      }\n\n      if(data.last_model !== \"\"){\n        $('input[name=\"model\"]').val(data.last_model);\n      }\n\n      if(data.last_color !== \"\"){\n        $('input[name=\"color\"]').val(data.last_color);\n      }\n    });\n</script> Once the profile has loaded, Lytics will call the JavaScript function and populate the form on the site. Once all the above steps are completed, the final code is as follows: HTML <!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>form value demo</title>\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    // Lytics JavaScript Tag\n    window.jstag=function(){function t(t){return function(){return t.apply(this,arguments),this}}function n(){var n=[\"ready\"].concat(c.call(arguments));return t(function(){n.push(c.call(arguments)),this._q.push(n)})}var i={_q:[],_c:{},ts:(new Date).getTime(),ver:\"2.0.0\"},c=Array.prototype.slice;return i.init=function(t){return i._c=t,t.synchronous||i.loadtagmgr(t),this},i.loadtagmgr=function(t){var n=document.createElement(\"script\");n.type=\"text/javascript\",n.async=!0,n.src=t.url+\"/api/tag/\"+t.cid+\"/lio.js\";var i=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];i.parentNode.insertBefore(n,i)},i.ready=n(),i.send=n(\"send\"),i.mock=n(\"mock\"),i.identify=n(\"identify\"),i.pageView=n(\"pageView\"),i.bind=t(function(t){i._q.push([t,c.call(arguments,1)])}),i.block=t(function(){i._c.blockload=!0}),i.unblock=t(function(){i._c.blockload=!1}),i}(),window.jstag.init({cid:\"{yourcid}\", url:\"//c.lytics.io\", min:true, loadid:false});\n  </script>\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    // Lytics Callback Handler\n    !function(l,a){a.liosetup=a.liosetup||{},a.liosetup.callback=a.liosetup.callback||[],a.liosetup.addEntityLoadedCallback=function(l,o){if(\"function\"==typeof a.liosetup.callback){var i=[];i.push(a.liosetup.callback),a.liosetup.callback=i}a.lio&&a.lio.loaded?l(a.lio.data):o?a.liosetup.callback.unshift(l):a.liosetup.callback.push(l)}}(document,window);\n\n    // Custom Callback Function\n    // This particular callback simply checks that the three values are not empty strings and then uses jQuery to update the form.\n    window.liosetup.addEntityLoadedCallback(function(data){\n      if(data.last_make !== \"\"){\n        $('input[name=\"make\"]').val(data.last_make);\n      }\n\n      if(data.last_model !== \"\"){\n        $('input[name=\"model\"]').val(data.last_model);\n      }\n\n      if(data.last_color !== \"\"){\n        $('input[name=\"color\"]').val(data.last_color);\n      }\n    });\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body> \n  <h2>A Sample Form</h2>\n  <form action='' method='post'>\n    <label>Make: </label><input type='text' name='make' value='' /><br/>\n    <label>Model: </label><input type='text' name='model' value='' /><br/>\n    <label>Color: </label><input type='text' name='color' value='' />\n  </form>\n</body>\n</html> This is one basic example of leveraging the current visitor's profile information. The personalization powered by Lytics builds from here. Using a similar pattern, you could surface new listings on the site's index page that match a user's last search or present other vehicles that user may be interested in.

    "content": "Google Marketing: Analytics, DV360, CM360 Suggest Edits Overview You can sync Lytics audiences to Google Analytics and Google Display & Video (DV360) in the Google Marketing Platform. Google Analytics is a web analytics service that is part of the Google Marketing Platform. Connect your Google Analytics account to Lytics to run more targeted marketing campaigns based on how your prospects, customers, and other Lytics audiences engage with your website. Lytics can pass all public audiences as a Custom Dimension to Google Analytics out-of-the-box. This allows for global filters based on Lytics audiences to be applied to reports, custom views and nearly every aspect of your existing Google Analytics account. Google DV360 enables marketers to manage their reservation, programmatic, and programmatic guaranteed campaigns across display, video, TV, audio, and other channels, all in one place. The Google DV360 Export in combination with the latest version of the Lytics JavaScript tag can be used to sync Lytics audiences to DV360. The Google Analytics Measurement Protocol for Google Analytics 4 allows users to augment their automatic collection via gtag, Tag Manager, and Google Analytics for Firebase. Export Lytics event streams or audiences via GA4 Measurement Protocol to tie online to offline behavior, or to send events to Google Analytics that happen outside user-interaction (e.g. offline conversions). Authorization Passing Lytics audiences to Google Analytics requires that the Lytics JavaScript tag be installed on your site. Also, keep in mind that any Lytics audience you would like to access in Google Analytics must be API enabled , which Lytics also refers to as \"public audiences\". This will ensure the JavaScript tag can pass the audience membership to Google Analytics. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Google Marketing from the list of providers. Select the method for authorization. Note that different methods may support different job types.

These steps will vary by method. Click Save Authorization . Google Sign-In Click Google Sign-in to initiate the authorization flow. Log in to the Google account you want to authorize and follow Google's instructions. GA4 Measurement Protocol API Secret To authorize with a GA4 Measurement Protocol API Secret you will need an API secret created in Google Analytics. Your GA4 API Secret can be found in the Google Analytics UI under Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement Protocol > Create . See the GA4 documentation for more information In the Label text box, enter a name for the authorization (optional) In the Description text box, enter a description for this authorization In the API Secret text box, enter your API Secret credential. DV360 Delegated Auth The Google DV360 export workflow does not require an authorization, as authorization is delegated to the Lytics DMP Google Ads account. In order to export to DV360 successfully, you will need to link your DV360 advertiser account with the Lytics DMP account. This is done in Google DV360 via the process described here . The Google DV360 export workflow requires the DV360 tag sync to be enabled in the Lytics account settings first. This configuration can be found in Vault, under Settings > Javascript tag . Google CM360 Sign-In Click Google Sign-in to initiate the authorization flow. Log in to the Google account you want to authorize and follow Google's instructions. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) GA4, which was first released into beta in 2019, has replaced Universal Analytics (UA) as the default version for Google Analytics installations. GA4 offers a great deal of flexibility and power over its predecessor. The following document outlines the preferred method for enriching GA4 with an individual's profile information, such as audience membership and Lytics user ID. There are a variety of robust use cases enabled by this integration, most notably the ability to filter GA4 dashboards by Lytics Audiences as well as distribute those audiences efficiently across the Google ecosystem from GA4 directly. Lastly, web properties are complicated by nature. The following recommended approach aims to focus on ease of installation while also preventing a limitation of the power of GA4. Please note that it is always recommended that you consult with your technical teams or partners before proceeding. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration (optional) and Client-side Integrations . Implementation Technique : JavaScript Tag Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration Resulting data : Audiences and/or User IDs in Google Analytics. If leveraging the workflow to configure new Dimensions on your behalf. Alternatively, custom user-scoped dimensions can be configured manually. Passing the audience membership data or IDs will leverage the profile request API within our JavaScript tag along with the GA4 set user_properties API. Step 1: Creating Dimensions To attribute onsite events such as page views or purchases, you must first define new Custom User Scoped Dimensions to store the set of audiences and/or User ID depending on preference. This can be done through our server-to-server integration, in which we'll create two properties: Lytics User ID (ly_user_id_dim) and Lytics Audiences (ly_segments_dim) . Alternatively, because we'll pass the data to Google via JavaScript, you can create whatever dimensions you want by following Google's documentation . If taking the manual approach, just be sure to use the user scope option during creation. For details on our server-to-server integration please view our Google Analytics: Setup Custom Dimensions instructions. Step 2: Enabling Lytics Audiences Once the necessary dimensions exist within your preferred Google Analytics account, you'll need to ensure all audiences you would like to send to GA4 are flagged as API Enabled from the Audience edit area of Lytics. This feature ensures no data is ever shared or passed to another tool without your explicit instructions to do so. Step 3: Configuring GA4 Finally, leveraging the profile listener feature of our JavaScript tag, we'll get details of the current visitor and pass those along to GA4 via your new dimensions. Since there are a nearly infinite number of ways sites can be configured and constructed, it is always best to consult your technical team on this step. Here we'll outline the most common approach assuming that GA4 tag installation default instructions were followed. Installing GA4 A typical installation of GA4 is completed by installing a few lines of JavaScript on your site. Typically in the header or footer. <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->\n<script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-D2LPRHX5G4\"></script>\n<script>\n    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n    gtag('js', new Date());\n\n    gtag('config', 'YOUR-PROPERTY-ID');\n</script> Setting User Properties This will also need to be modified to include the setting of your custom dimensions as well as optionally altering how the initial pageview event is fired. The following example shows ultimately how we'll be sending data to GA4. gtag('set', 'user_properties', {\n    'ly_segments_dim': 'one,two,three',\n    'ly_user_id_dim': 'myid123'\n}); Getting Profile Data To pass the current user's audience information as well as optional user ID, you'll first need to retrieve the profile via our personalization API. Luckily the Lytics tag makes this simple using our entityready listener . The Lytics tag will call the desired function once it has identified the user and accessed their profile. Using the information returned, we'll send the user properties as outlined above. <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var myCallbackFunction = function(profile){\n      // do something here with the profile\n      console.log(profile.data.user.segments);\n  }\n\n  jstag.call('entityReady', myCallbackFunction); // register the listener\n</script> Full Example We'll alter the default listener example to verify we did receive audience membership data and then pass that along to GA4 as our lytics_segments_dim dimensions or whatever you named it during the manual creation process. <!-- Start Send Lytics Audiences to GA4 -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    var handleGA4UserProperties = function(profile){\n        if (window.gtag) {\n            // ensure we have segments to send to prevent javascript errors\n            if(typeof profile != \"undefined\" && typeof profile.data != \"undefined\" && typeof profile.data.user != \"undefined\" && typeof profile.data.user.segments != \"undefined\") {\n                // send the audience membership to GA4 as a user property\n                gtag('set', 'user_properties', {\n                    'ly_segments_dim': profile.data.user.segments.join(',')\n                });\n            };\n        } else {\n            // log a warning if the profile can't be accessed\n            console.warn('unable to set audience membership in GA4');\n        }\n    }\n\n    jstag.call('entityReady', handleGA4UserProperties); // register the entityReady listener\n</script>\n<!-- End Send Lytics Audiences to GA4 --> In this case, we also log a warning to the console when a set of audience memberships are unavailable for debugging purposes. For demonstration purposes, a full HTML example of loading the GA4 tag, Lytics tag, and listener function might look like the following: <html>\n    <head>\n        <!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->\n        <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-D2LPRHX5G4\"></script>\n        <script>\n            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n            gtag('js', new Date());\n\n            gtag('config', 'YOUR-GA4-PROPERTY-ID');\n        </script>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        Lytics GA4 Demonstration\n\n        <!-- Start Lytics Tracking Tag Version 3 -->\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            !function(){\"use strict\";var o=window.jstag||(window.jstag={}),r=[];function n(e){o[e]=function(){for(var n=arguments.length,t=new Array(n),i=0;i<n;i++)t[i]=arguments[i];r.push([e,t])}}n(\"send\"),n(\"mock\"),n(\"identify\"),n(\"pageView\"),n(\"unblock\"),n(\"getid\"),n(\"setid\"),n(\"loadEntity\"),n(\"getEntity\"),n(\"on\"),n(\"once\"),n(\"call\"),o.loadScript=function(n,t,i){var e=document.createElement(\"script\");e.async=!0,e.src=n,e.onload=t,e.onerror=i;var o=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0],r=o&&o.parentNode||document.head||document.body,c=o||r.lastChild;return null!=c?r.insertBefore(e,c):r.appendChild(e),this},o.init=function n(t){return this.config=t,this.loadScript(t.src,function(){if(o.init===n)throw new Error(\"Load error!\");o.init(o.config),function(){for(var n=0;n<r.length;n++){var t=r[n][0],i=r[n][1];o[t].apply(o,i)}r=void 0}()}),this}}();\n            // Define config and initialize Lytics tracking tag.\n            // - The setup below will disable the automatic sending of Page Analysis Information (to prevent duplicative sends, as this same information will be included in the jstag.pageView() call below, by default)\n            jstag.init({\n            src: 'https://c.lytics.io/api/tag/YOUR-LYTICS-ACCOUNT-ID/latest.min.js',\n            pageAnalysis: {\n                dataLayerPull: {\n                disabled: true\n                }\n            }\n            });\n\n            // You may need to send a page view, depending on your use-case\n            jstag.pageView();\n        </script>\n\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            var handleGA4UserProperties = function(profile){\n                if (window.gtag) {\n                    // ensure we have segments to send to prevent javascript errors\n                    if(typeof profile != \"undefined\" && typeof profile.data != \"undefined\" && typeof profile.data.user != \"undefined\" && typeof profile.data.user.segments != \"undefined\") {\n                        // send the audience membership to GA4 as a user property\n                        gtag('set', 'user_properties', {\n                            'ly_segments_dim': profile.data.user.segments.join(',')\n                        });\n                    };\n                } else {\n                    // log a warning if the profile can't be accessed\n                    console.warn('unable to set audience membership in GA4');\n                }\n            }\n\n            jstag.call('entityReady', handleGA4UserProperties); // register the entityReady listener\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html> Additional Considerations At this point, you should successfully pass audience membership to GA4 for each user. Given the flexibility of GA4, there are a variety of configuration options. That said, there are a couple of common points that are worth considering. The load order of tags is essential. For this to work correctly, you'll want to load tags in this order: GA4 Lytics Tag Lytics Listener It may be desired that the GA4 default pageView tag is delayed until the profile information has been set. This ensures all events are associated with the user but could impact the efficiency of tracking page views. This is only recommended for advanced users with a firm understanding of JavaScript. In this case, you would disable the default page view as described here and then fire it manually following the setting of the user properties in our example. It may be desired to send an event to GA4 noting when the properties are set. This can be done following the entityready function and the user properties being set. For more information on the various ways to configure events, consult Google's documentation . When testing your integration, Google supports a debug setting in their tag configuration settings. These settings allow access to a debug view where you can see the events stream in real-time to confirm proper behavior. Step 4: Add GA4 Audience The final step of this integration is to follow Google's recommended approach for building an audience inside of GA4 using custom dimensions. When prompted which dimension to use, you'll want to select the ly_segments_dim or whatever custom parameter you created and then match based on the value of your audience or a regex match. When passing the audiences to GA4, Lytics converts them to a string separated by commas as Google does not accept arrays. As such, the dimension value will look similar to audience1,audience2,audience3 . Google DV360: Cookie Matching Export Combining this export job with the latest version of the Lytics JavaScript Tag allows you to create powerful audiences for targeting in Google DV360. 📘 Due to a Google requirement beginning March 1, 2024, the User Consent Confirmed checkbox must be selected for the DV360 Export Audiences workflow to run successfully. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration and Client-side Integrations . Implementation Technique : JavaScript Tag Integration , REST API Integration , Audience Trigger Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : A Lytics audience is synced to Google DV360. The name will be equal to the audience slug in Lytics. The client-side part of this integration uses the Lytics JavaScript tag (Version 3) and Google DV360 cookie sync to sync visitors to your website. Once a user visits a page of your website where the tag is installed and the DV360 plugin is enabled, the following will happen: The user's browser will send an event to Lytics with the user's cookie ID. The user's browser will send a request to the DV360 cookie sync endpoint with Lytics' Google Network ID and the user's Lytics cookie ID in base64 encoding. Google DV360 will map the Lytics cookie ID to a cookie ID in their system. When an export job is created in Lytics, it will do the following: Create a list in Google DV360 corresponding to the Lytics audience being exported via the Google DV360 proprietary API. The name of the list will be equal to the Audience slug in Lytics. If a DV360 list with that name already exists, the job will use the pre-existing list. Scan the Lytics audience for current members. For every audience member, the job will check its Lytics profile for the dv360_id_ts field, which indicates when the the user was last synced by the client-side cookie sync. If the timestamp does not exist or is older than 90 days, the user will be ignored. For users with a valid dv360_id_ts field, the job will send the user's Lytics cookie ID to Google DV360. Google DV360 will use the match table in their system from the cookie sync to find the user's DV360 ID and add it to the audience. The job will listen continually for enter and exit events. Users will be added and removed from the audience in Google DV360 via the process described above as they enter or exit the Lytics audience. Fields By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Google Marketing DV360. Lytics User Field Description Google Marketing Field Type _uid Web Cookie Id(current) Google DV360 ID string Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Google Marketing in the Lytics platform.

    "content": "LiveRamp Suggest Edits Overview LiveRamp is an identity resolution platform that provides data onboarding and connectivity services. It connects campaign exposure data, offline purchase data, and third-party data at the consumer level to help create a unified view of customer activity. Integrating Lytics with LiveRamp lets you leverage Lytics insights, behavioral data, and content affinities with LiveRamp's identity resolution to better understand and target your consumers. 📘 Before starting a workflow, it's important to understand the terminology differences of “audiences” and \"segments\" between LiveRamp and Lytics: LiveRamp “audiences” are a collection of users included for cross-device identity resolution. The corresponding concept in Lytics is the file being exported from Lytics into LiveRamp. Lytics “audiences” are sent as attributes (columns) within the file exported to a single LiveRamp audience. Each Lytics audience inside a file will become a “segment” in LiveRamp. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup a LiveRamp account before you begin the process described below. There are additional configuration steps that will need to be done in LiveRamp before the exported file can be fully processed. Reach out to your technical point of contact at LiveRamp to complete this configuration. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select LiveRamp from the list of providers. Select one of the following methods for authorization: S3 CSV Authorization SFTP Authorization Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. Complete the configuration steps for your authorization. These steps will vary by method. Click Save Authorization . S3 CSV Authorization Follow the steps below if you want to drop the file in a S3 bucket before importing into LiveRamp. Select Enter AWS Keys . In the Access Key box, enter your AWS S3 access key. In the Secret Key box, enter your AWS S3 secret key. SFTP CSV Authorization Follow the steps below if you want to drop the file on an SFTP server before importing into LiveRamp. Click LiveRamp SFTP Server with Username/Password . In the Host box, enter the host name or IP address of the SFTP server you want to upload to. In the Port box, enter the port number for the SFTP server. In the Username box, enter the username for the SFTP server. In the Password box, enter the password for the SFTP server. In the Folder box, enter the relative path to the folder to place the CSV. Contact your technical point of contact at LiveRamp to ensure this directory is in place. Export Audiences (S3) Exporting user profiles and audience membership to LiveRamp allows you use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics combined with LiveRamp's identity resolution to fine-tune your targeting. Export your audience to S3 in a LiveRamp CSV format. Use S3 to stage your files before importing into LiveRamp. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : File Based Transfer Integration . Frequency : Batch Integration with Backfill , frequency can be configured. Resulting data : User Profile s and audience membership. Data is exported as a CSV with a header row . The columns are an identifier field in the first column, followed by user profile fields, followed by audience membership. Audience membership is represented by columns containing the digit 1 if the user is a member of that audience and blank if not. Headers for the audience membership columns are the audience slugs. This integration operates by creating a CSV file in S3 to be imported by LiveRamp. Once started, the integration will: Create a multipart upload in the selected S3 bucket. Write CSV headers to the S3 file. Scan the audience and process users into CSV lines. Write CSV lines to the S3 file. Complete a multipart upload after writing all users to the file. Schedule the next run. LiveRamp imports the file for processing. See LiveRamp's documentation for details on setting up LiveRamp to import the file. 📘 It usually takes 1-2 days for a file to fully process into LiveRamp, another 1-2 days to distribute that audience to ad platforms, then another 1-2 days for statistics on match rates to be available in the LiveRamp UI. So, for a first time setup end-to-end, it can take about a week. Fields By default, Lytics will export the full user profile and audience membership to LiveRamp. Note that you can customize the Lytics source fields as part of the job configuration : Lytics User Field Description LiveRamp Field Type email Email Address email string N/A audience membership lytics_audience_slug int Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export of LiveRamp in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Destinations documentation for more information.. Select LiveRamp from the list of providers. Select the Export Audiences (S3) job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. From the Audiences input, select the audience(s) that contains the users to export. From the S3 Bucket Name input, select the bucket to save your file in. If no buckets are listed, enter the bucket name in the field below. From the S3 Bucket Name (Alt) text input, enter the S3 bucket name here if no buckets are listed above. This may occur if your access token does not have permission to list S3 buckets. From the Directory input, choose the directory to save your file in. This option can be slow on large S3 buckets. From the Identifier input, select the field that will be placed in the first column of the file. This field should be a unique identifier and be selected in the Fields to export . Click on the Show Advanced Options tab to expand the advanced configuration. From the Filename text input, enter the name of the file to upload. {TIMESTAMP} will be replaced by the timestamp when the export occurred, in Unix format. From the Timestamp format input, select the format for the timestamp in the filename. From the Audience Membership input, select the audiences  to include in the audience membership. From the Compress input, select your compression preference for the exported file. Select the Additional Audiences checkbox to add a column containing all the audiences a user is a member of. From the Fields to Export input, select the user fields to export. From the Custom Delimiter text input, enter a custom delimiter for your file. The default is a comma, a recommended alternate is a pipe \"|\". From the Custom Join input, enter a custom join character for fields that have multiple values. The default is \"&\". E.g. [email protected] & [email protected] . Select the Continuous Export checkbox to export the audience repeatedly. From the File Export Frequency input, select how often a continuous export should create a new file. From the Time of Day input, select the time of day to start the export each day. This applies to daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies only. From the Timezone input, select the timezone for time of day. Click Start Export . Export Audiences (SFTP) Exporting user profiles and audience membership to LiveRamp allows you use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics combined with LiveRamp's identity resolution to fine-tune your targeting. Export your audience to an SFTP server in a LiveRamp CSV format. Use SFTP to stage your files before importing into LiveRamp. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : File Based Transfer Integration . Frequency : Batch Integration with Backfill , frequency can be configured. Resulting data : User Profile s and audience membership. Data is exported as a CSV with a header row . The columns are an identifier field in the first column, followed by user profile fields, followed by audience membership. Audience membership is represented by columns containing the digit 1 if the user is a member of that audience and blank if not. Headers for the audience membership columns are the audience slugs. This integration operates by creating a CSV file formatted for LiveRamp on an SFTP server so it can be imported by LiveRamp. Once the integration is started it will: Connect to the SFTP server. Navigate to the configured folder in the SFTP server. Create a CSV file in the SFTP server. Write CSV headers to the file. Scan the audience and process users into CSV lines. Write CSV lines to the file. Close the completed file and disconnect from the SFTP server. Schedule the next run. LiveRamp imports the file for processing. See LiveRamp's documentation for details on setting up LiveRamp to import the file. 📘 It usually takes 1-2 days for a file to fully process into LiveRamp, another 1-2 days to distribute that audience to ad platforms, then another 1-2 days for statistics on match rates to be available in the LiveRamp UI. So, for a first time setup end-to-end, it can take about a week. Fields By default, Lytics will export the full user profile and audience membership to LiveRamp. Note that you can customize the Lytics source fields as part of the job configuration : Lytics User Field LiveRamp Field Type email email string N/A lytics_audience_slug int Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export of LiveRamp in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Destinations documentation for more information. Select LiveRamp from the list of providers.

From the Time of Day input, select the time of day to start the export each day. This applies to daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies only. From the Timezone input, select the timezone for time of day. Click Start Export . Export Audiences (EU Format) Exporting user profiles and audience membership to LiveRamp allows you to use behavioral data, content affinities, and insights from Lytics combined with LiveRamp's identity resolution to fine-tune your targeting. Export your audience to an SFTP server in a LiveRamp CSV EU format. Use SFTP to stage your files before importing into LiveRamp. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : File Based Transfer Integration . Frequency : Batch Integration with Backfill , frequency can be configured. Resulting data : User Profile s and audience membership. This job exports the user profiles as a CSV file. The CSV file format is specific and follows the Liveramp EU CSV format. The number of User Fields that will be exported is limited. We also append an audience column which will contain the Lytics audience name or slug the user is part of and can be configured . This integration once started it will: Connect to the SFTP server. Navigate to the configured folder in the SFTP server. Create a CSV file in the SFTP server. Write CSV headers to the file. Scan the audience and process users into CSV lines. Write CSV lines to the file. Close the completed file and disconnect from the SFTP server. Schedule the next run. LiveRamp imports the file for processing. See LiveRamp's documentation for details on setting up LiveRamp to import the file. Fields We follow the Liveramp SFTP file format to create the SFTP file. Following table shows the fields that can be mapped and exported. By default, none of the below fields are mapped except for Customer ID which will be filled by the Unique Identifier. Note that you can customize the Lytics source fields as part of the job configuration .

Use this RampID to identify consumers to target with more relevant ad campaigns. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration - Audience Trigger Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : User Field s, Raw Event Data. This integration uses the LiveRamp API to acquire the RampID for the envelope belonging to the user. Please refer to the documentation on Ramp IDs to learn more about it. Each job run will proceed as follows: Creates a temporary Lytics Audience with users that have LiveRamp envelope ID configured during job creation. Sends the envelope ID to LiveRamp's Envelope Decryption endpoint to acquire the user's RampID. Sends the user's RampID data along with their envelope ID to stream liveramp_id_enrich so that it can be mapped as a user profile field. Once the ID is enriched, it is refreshed whenever the envelope ID is changed. Fields The following fields are included in the default mapping of the liveramp_id_enrich stream: Source Field Lytics User Field Description Type rampid ramp_id Last LiveRamp ID string rampid_ts rampid_ts LiveRamp ID Last Updated Time date set(ramp_id) ramp_ids All LiveRamp IDs []string set(last_ramp_envelope) ramp_envelopes All LiveRamp Envelopes []string Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an enrich job for Liveramp in the Lytics platform. Select LiveRamp from the list of providers. Select the RampID Enrichment job from the list under the Enrich category. Select the Lytics Managed Key authorization type. Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. From the Envelope ID Field input, select the Lytics user field that contains LiveRamp Envelope ID. Click Start Enrich . Collect LiveRamp Envelope via ATS Associate a Lytics profile with a LiveRamp encrypted envelope as a means to power the LiveRamp RampID Enrichment integration. This approach should be leveraged only when a known identifier is present such as email. Integration Details Implementation Type : Client-side Integrations . Implementation Technique : Client-side Integrations JavaScript Tag Integration Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : Event Implementation 🚧 Ensure that your website is already configured with the LiveRamp ATS tag. Implementation of this tag is outside of the pervue of Lytics but is a requirement to collect and send the envelope from your customer's browser to Lytics. Option 1 Option 1 for implementation is recommended. This option leverages an event listener to send ATS envelope information to Lytics as soon as it is received from ATS. Additional information about this approach is available in LiveRamps documentation . Javascript window.addEventListener(\"fbEnvelopePresent\", async () => {\n   const envelope = await ats.retrieveEnvelope(undefined, '_lr_fb_env');\n   try{\n      var parsedEnvelope = JSON.parse(envelope);\n      if(parsedEnvelope.envelope !== ''){\n         jstag.send('default', {'liveramp_idl': parsedEnvelope.envelope});\n      }\n   }catch(e){\n      console.log(\"Error parsing and deliverying envelope to Lytics: \", e);\n   }\n}); Option 2 Option 2 for implementation is focused on sending data to Lytics if you are confident that an ATS-managed envelope will already be in place when the page loads. It is always best to consult with your web development team to ensure that suggested implementation patterns are compatible with your environment(s). Javascript ats.retrieveEnvelope((envelope)=>{\n   try{\n      var parsedEnvelope = JSON.parse(envelope);\n      if(parsedEnvelope.envelope !== ''){\n         jstag.send('default', {liveramp_idl: parsedEnvelope.envelope});\n      }\n   }catch(e){\n      console.log(\"Error parsing and deliverying envelope to Lytics: \", e);\n   }\n}) Adding Additional Context Regardless of the implementation option, adding additional context may be beneficial. For instance, you can incorporate a variable into the payload to track a specific LiveRamp envelope originating from ATS. As illustrated below, for any envelope sourced from ATS, the event will include a variable named _e holding the value \"ATS_AUTHENTICATED.\" This variable can subsequently be utilized for mapping profiles, reporting, data analysis, and more. Javascript ats.retrieveEnvelope((envelope)=>{\n   try{\n      var parsedEnvelope = JSON.parse(envelope);\n      if(parsedEnvelope.envelope !== ''){\n         jstag.send('default', {liveramp_idl: parsedEnvelope.envelope, _e: \"ATS_AUTHENTICATED\"});\n      }\n   }catch(e){\n      console.log(\"Error parsing and deliverying envelope to Lytics: \", e);\n   }\n}) Collect LiveRamp Envelope via RTIS Associate a Lytics profile with a LiveRamp encrypted envelope as a means to power the LiveRamp RampID Enrichment integration. This approach should be leveraged when there is no known identifier present. Integration Details Implementation Type : Client-side Integrations . Implementation Technique : Client-side Integrations JavaScript Tag Integration Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : Event Implementation Steps Configure Endpoint for Receiving Pixel & UID Link Configure Client Side Pixel Configure Endpoint for Receiving Pixel & UID Link Upon completion, a tracking pixel will be initialized to a LiveRamp domain (we'll cover this in step 2). LiveRamp will associate the anonymous _uid from Lytics with their Ramp Envelope and return that association to an API endpoint at Lytics. To get started, we must ensure that LiveRamp sends the link data to the proper Lytics endpoint and your account is configured to receive and associate that data with user profiles. (Required) Provide proper URL to the LiveRamp team for forwarding RTIS pixel call to (Manged in LiveRamp). https://c.lytics.io/c/provider/liveramp (Optional) Stream configuration By default, all link data will be delivered to the liveramp_idl data stream. If you would like this data to be delivered to an alternate stream, you can configure the account setting liveramp_idl_stream to point to your desired stream. (Required) Map link data to your user profiles. For each identity that is linked, the configured stream will receive the following key/value pairs: origin_acct : the full ID of the account for which the initial request was made. _uid : the user in question anonymous Lytics web cookie. liveramp_idl : the LiveRamp Envelope associated with the _uid. Though you may map this data any way you see fit, we highly recommend following this pattern: SELECT\n      epochms()               AS lr_idl_timestamp             SHORTDESC \"Date of Resolution\"          KIND DATE\n      , origin_acct           AS lr_origin_acct               SHORTDESC \"Account of Origin\"\n      ,liveramp_idl           AS last_ramp_envelope           SHORTDESC \"Last LiveRamp Envelope\"           \n \n--BY FIELDS\n      , set(_uid)             AS _uids                        SHORTDESC \"Web Cookie Ids(all)\"                     KIND []string\n      ,set(liveramp_idl)      AS ramp_envelopes               SHORTDESC \"All LiveRamp Envelopes\"        KIND []string\n \nFROM liveramp_idl\nINTO user\nBY _uids OR ramp_envelopes\nALIAS liveramp_idl Configure Client Side Pixel RTIS leverages a cookie sync integration between Lytics and LiveRamp. Below is an example implementation. It is always best to consult your web development team to ensure the proper checks and balances are in place to prevent unplanned errors and impacts on site traffic based on your unique environment. JavaScript jstag.getid(function(id){\n   // ensure a valid _uid is available\n   if(id === ''){\n      console.warn('Lytics ID is empty');\n      return;\n   }\n\n   // ensure we haven't recently envoked this integration\n   var previouslySent = jstag.getCookie(\"lyticsLrIdl\");\n   if (previouslySent != null && previouslySent !== '') {\n      console.log('liveramp idl integration already sent');\n      return;\n  }\n\n   // add pixel\n   var src = '[liveramp_pixel_url]' + '?cparams=' + jstag.config.cid[0] + '-' + id;\n   var img = document.createElement(\"img\");\n   img.src = src;\n   img.style = \"display:none;\"\n   document.body.appendChild(img);\n\n   // set a cookie to prevent envoking pixel again within the next week\n   jstag.setCookie(\"lyticsLrIdl\", id, 604800)\n}); 📘 The liveramp_pixel_url will be provided by the LiveRamp team and generally will look similar to the following https://id.rlcdn.com/xxxxxxxx.gif .

    "content": "Ansira This integration facilitates the enrichment of Lytics user profiles with valuable information, including identifiers, activity data, and more from Ansira. Suggest Edits Overview Enabling the Ansira and Lytics integration empowers customers to enhance Lytics user profiles by incorporating user-level data from the Ansira platform. This integration facilitates the enrichment of Lytics user profiles with valuable information, including identifiers, activity data, and more. By seamlessly connecting Ansira's extensive data resources with the Lytics user profiling capabilities, customers gain a comprehensive understanding of their users' preferences, behaviors, and interactions. This enables more personalized and targeted marketing strategies, fostering deeper customer engagement and driving better business outcomes. Authorization To successfully send and receive requests to the Ansira APIs, we must create an OAuth-based authorization using the key and secret outlined below. Select Provider This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting the Webhooks provider tile. Select Method Next, select an authorization method. If this is your first time creating an authorization for Ansira, select OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant . Configure Authorization Next, we'll configure the authorization to use a key and secret provided by Ansira. Please configure all fields as outlined below and leave any additional fields blank unless you fully understand the implications. Label Create a label for your authorization. This will only be surfaced in the Lytics UI for easy navigation when selecting the authorization in additional workflows or reviewing the details and logs. Description Add an optional description to provide context for where the auth came from and how it will be used. Token URL Ansira will provide the token URL. This is the endpoint used to get a token. In most cases, your specific instance information will replace the XXXX in the example. Client ID Enter the provided Client ID from Ansira. Client Secret Enter the provided Client Secret from Ansira. Additional Request Parameters Lastly, since the Ansira API expects an access token as part of the request, we must configure the additional parameters to include the token generated via OAuth, as described below. access_token={token} Enrichment Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration s - Audience Trigger Integration - Webhook Integration Frequency : Real-time Integration that continuously enriches users as they fall into a source audience. Resulting data : A data stream populated with response data from Ansira containing critical information such as UUID and more that can then be mapped back into the profile. This integration utilizes the Lytics' Enrichment Webhook to send a secure request to Ansira when a user enters a source audience. This request is sent to the POST/service/api/v2/user endpoint and contains user data configured within the template described below to enrich a Lytics profile with extended information about that user within Ansira. We'll outline the following steps to achieve enable this enrichment workflow: Create an Authorization to Ansira Create a source audience to determine which profiles need to be enriched. Create a webhook template to format the outbound request to Ansira's v2/user API correctly. Prepare your user schema to receive the response data from Ansira. Create a real-time enrichment webhook sync between Lytics & Ansira. Validate that the enrichment flow is working as expected. Authorization Select or configure a new authorization as outlined above . Audience This integration works by ensuring every member of an audience has been enriched with Ansira data. In most cases, the desired outcome is matching a UUID or Ansira-specific identifier with an email address. Though the source audience is ultimately up to each customer's discretion, we recommend keeping the following in mind: Every user entering the audience will receive an API call to Ansira. This may impact limits and cost, so one general rule of thumb is to define your source audience by highlighting that the desired data is missing and should only be enriched when the prerequisites are met. For example: If I am collecting email addresses from a web form and I want to be sure that every known user with an email address also has an Ansira UUID, I would define my source audience as all users with an email address and no UUID. This ensures we only make calls for users with an email that has not been enriched. Create Webhook Template Webhook templates are created using jsonnet . These templates provide a flexible way to reformat the outbound payload of a webhook request to meet the recipient's requirements. In this case, we'll create a template that provides the proper formatting of email and source ids for the Ansira user API. This step may appear to be technical. As such, if you need assistance, please get in touch with your technical account manager or primary point of contact. Shell echo 'local event = (import \"lytemplates.libsonnet\");\n{\n\t\"email\": event.get(\"email\", \"\"),\n  \"sourceCode\": {\n  \t\"keyName\": \"XXXXXXXXXXXXX\"\n  }\n}' | http -v POST https://api.lytics.io/v2/template name==ansira_temp type==jsonnet account_id=={YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID} key=={YOUR-API-TOKEN} Jsonnet is highly customizable. In the example above, we pull the email from the profile and hard code a sourceCode keyName If the desire is for the keyName to be dynamic, this could also leverage the. event.get method to pull the value from each profile. If you use the dynamic method, the field name in the event.get() function is the field name that has been defined in the Lytics schema, as seen in the example below: echo 'local event = (import \"lytemplates.libsonnet\");\n{\n\t\"field_name_to_send_to_ansira\": event.get(\"lytics_field_name\", \"\"),\n\n}' | http -v POST https://api.lytics.io/v2/template name==ansira_temp type==jsonnet account_id=={YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID} key=={YOUR-API-TOKEN} Schema To handle the response from the enrichment APIs, you'll need to add the necessary fields and mappings within Conductor to process the data correctly. In our example, we will only be mapping the email back as an identifier to ensure data is correctly stitched to the profile, along with a new field called \"Ansira UUID,\" which will hold the UUID for each user. 📘 When altering schema it is always best to consult with your internal technical resources or those available to you from Lytics to ensure everything is configured adequately. Create the new Ansira UUID Field Create New Mapping for the Ansira UUID Field Create New Mapping for the Existing Email Field 📘 Remembering what stream you decide to use for the mappings is important, as it will be needed when configuring the enrichment workflow. Configure Enrichment Webhook In the final step, we will bring it all together by configuring our webhook destination to use the auth, template, and audience to enrich a Lytics profile. Select Provider This integration leverages our Webhook integration to connect with and retrieve data from Ansira's endpoints. Begin by selecting the Webhooks provider tile. Select Job Type Next, select the Webhook User Enrichment job type. This webhook job will pass the response of each request to the configured data stream to be mapped back to a user's profile. Configuration Select Source Audience(s) Select one or more audiences to enrich with Ansira data. We highly recommend following the suggested approach in the audience of this doc to prevent invalid or unnecessary calls to the Ansira API. Define Stream Define the stream you'd like the response data passed to. This stream must align with your updated schema and mappings as outlined above. Select Webhook Template Select the template that was created in the previous step. Set Webhook URL Enter the full v2/users endpoint provided by Ansira. Set Webhook URL Select profile fields to export. At a minimum, you must select all fields necessary to fulfill your jsonnet template. In our example, this would only be email . Existing Users Finally, determine if you'd like to send all existing audience members to the enrichment endpoint. Selecting this box may send many API requests immediately upon saving your configuration.

    "content": "Schema Copilot Suggest Edits Overview Schema Copilot revolutionizes how users manage data connections, streamlining the integration process with our Customer Data Platform (CDP), Lytics. Before starting this document, it is important to understand some key fundamentals regarding fields and mappings, which can be found here . Streamlined Data Integration Process Integrating custom data into Lytics is simplified into two straightforward steps: Schema Definition : Outline the schema to dictate how your new data source should update existing customer profiles. Data Stream Creation : Establish a new data stream tailored to your source to ensure seamless data flow. Features of Schema Copilot Schema Copilot leverages advanced generative artificial intelligence to comprehensively scrutinize your new data source. It offers intuitive suggestions for fields and mappings, enabling seamless integration of your new data source with the existing schema. This intelligent assistance ensures that your data aligns perfectly with the Lytics platform, enhancing your customer data integration's overall efficiency and accuracy. Getting Started To get started with Schema Copilot: Navigate to the Schema Copilot wizard. Fill out the \"Provide Data\" box with an example of your data source's data, either JSON or CSV. In the \"Additional Prompt\" box, you can also give the model more directives. JSON Example Tip: If you do not correctly input the JSON, you will see an error message on the red banner. CSV Example Select the stream from which the data is going to be coming in. (Optional) If you would like to have more complex data types or only map data in certain conditions you can do that using the \"Additional Prompt Box\" Example of Adding a prompt based on the CSV file input: Now, on the email mapping for the default stream, you will see a condition that requires the first name to exist. Click \"Suggest Schema\" and review the suggestions in the editable data grid. If you want to accept the suggestions, click \"Save Schema.\" If you don't, you can return to the first step to change your data or prompt or exit the wizard entirely. Understanding the Suggested Schema View: Field rows will have the following columns: Field Name : The field's name being added or updated. If there is a green dot on this row, the field is new; if the dot is yellow, then the field already exists and is being updated. The lock next to the field indicates that this is an identifier and, therefore, cannot be edited as it would impact the integrity of the profiles already built. Type : This will indicate the data type. To better understand Lytics Field data types, please visit here . Merge Op : This will indicate how data merges into this field over time and is defined here . Description : This is the short description of the field and will act as the field name for the audience builder. Is Identifier : This will indicate whether it is an identifier. Mappings : The number of mappings recommended for the field based on Mappings will have the following columns: Stream: This will be the data source that will populate the mapping. In the example above, the stream is \"default,\" Lytics Jstag's default stream. Expression: This is where additional aggregation, cleansing, hashing, string parsing, and manipulation can be done using LQL. Adding more context to the \"Additional Prompt\" Section will automatically populate some expressions. To learn more about what expressions are available, please look here . Condition: Additional logic should be used to decide if the data should map. This will use the LQL syntax. Once the suggestions are saved, you can publish the changes by clicking \"Publish Changes\" on your Schema Dashboard.

    "title": "Components",
    "content": "Components Suggest Edits Introduction Reports can consist of one or many Components . Think of a Component as a method of visualizing data. Each Component provides different ways of displaying and drilling into your data. Supported Components: The Size component allows you to display the sizes of one or more Audiences as a line chart or numeric value. This component helps compare the sizes of different Audiences (ex: for A/B testing). The Composition component allows you to understand and chart the distribution of values for a field across your audience in various ways, including Bar, Pie, Line, and Table view. The Audience Overlap component allows you to understand the intersection or difference in audience members between two or more audiences. The Data Flow component allows you to visualize the flow of data that connects your Providers, Audiences, and Destinations. Creating Components You can select from a list of Component types by clicking the + Add New Component button on the Report Page. Click on the desired component to add it to your Report. Managing Components Lytics provides a handful of methods of managing your Report Components. Configuration : Once you've created your Component, click on the Edit Component button in the lower right corner to configure your Component. Minification : To minimize, or hide a component, click on the minimize(-) icon in the upper-right corner of the Component. Stacking : Merge multiple data points into a single visualization or separate each point into its unique component for streamlined consumption. Shrink/Expand : If your Report has many components, it may be desirable to 'shrink' your components to display more information on a single page. To shrink your components, click on the \"Shrink\" icon in the upper-right corner of the Component. Deleting : Click on the expanded menu in the upper-right corner to delete your component. Hiding/Showing Missing Values : By default, \"null\" values are hidden from view. This prevents individual component visualizations from being offset by profiles with missing data. For instance, in the two examples below, you'll see an overview of visitor geo, but if we \"show missing values,\" you'll see a large portion of the users in the audience do not have a geo value at all. This may be preferred in some cases and can be toggled on or off to meet your needs. Organization : As you add components, you will likely want to customize where and how they appear. The location of a particular component can be adjusted easily by simply clicking any edge of a component and dragging it to its desired location. Don't forget to save your changes so they are retained the next time you visit your report. Component Types Size Comparison Size Comparison components allow you to display multiple Audience Sizes on one chart. This component can help compare multiple audiences simultaneously, commonly used for variation testing. Creating and Editing Size Components To create a Size component, select one or many Audiences in the Edit Component menu. In the configuration menu, you can set the Component's name , description , and Audiences based on the selected table . After selecting and saving the Audience(s), the Component will display a time-series chart of the Audience size(s). Customizing Size Components Once a Size component is created, the time-range and the stacked options can be selected. By default, the Size component will chart the last seven days of data. To customize the start and end dates, click on the dates in the upper-right section of the component. To display the Audience sizes on separate charts, toggle the Stacked option in the lower left section of the component. Size components can also be visualized as a single number by selecting the Number chart type. Audience Overlap Audience Overlap components allow you to understand the intersection or lack thereof between two or more Lytics audiences. Creating and Editing Overlap Components To create an Overlap component, select one or many Audiences in the Edit Component menu. In the configuration menu, you can set the Component's name , description , and Audiences . After selecting and saving the Audience(s), the Component will display a Venn diagram representing each audience and their collective overlap. Activating Insights These insights can be quickly activated by clicking directly on any intersections. This will take you to a pre-populated audience definition with rules defined representing the portion of the diagram you clicked on. For instance, in the above example, clicking on. Multi Session Visitors within the Has Visited Web audience will produce the following audience definition. Data Flow Data Flow components allow you to see how data flows through your connected Providers, Data Streams, Audiences, and Destinations. Creating and Editing Data Flow Components To create a Data Flow component, select up to 5 Audiences in the Edit Component menu. In the configuration menu, you can set the Component's name , description , and Audiences . After selecting and saving the Audience(s), the Component will display a Bipartite diagram containing each of the selected Audiences and the connected Providers, Streams, and Destinations. The Edit Component menu also provides options to hide (or display) the Providers, Streams, or Destination columns. This allows the user to \"zoom in\" on different aspects of the Data Flow diagram. Activating Insights Insights for this Component can be accessed by hovering over or clicking directly on any line in the diagram. Hovering over a line will prompt the Dataflow Tooltip, which contains information about the Job - such as when it was created and the number of users exported. Clicking directly on the line will take you to the Job's page for the corresponding job. For instance, clicking on the yellow line between \"All\" and \"Google Cloud\" will redirect you to this page. Composition Composition components allow you to visualize a field in the user or content schema across one or many Audiences. This can be useful to compare a field across Audiences or to analyze the data distribution for a group of users. Creating Composition Components To create a Composition component, click on the Edit Component button. In the configuration menu, the name , description (optional), Audiences , Field and SubField can be selected. Depending on the field type, Lytics provides a variety of ways to visualize the data. The data can be viewed as a Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Table, or Stats view for numeric fields. The following table shows all of the chart types for each field type. Field Type Bar Line Pie Table Stats string x x x x x number x x x Date x x x []string x x x x x map[string]string x x x x x map[string]number x x x map[string]date x x x []number x x x []date x x x Chart Types Bar Chart : Display your data as a horizontal Bar Chart, where each Audience is represented in a different color. The labels correspond to each value of the Field , and the values are the number of users with the field value. Example : the Bar Chart below shows the number of Rewards Users across 2 Audiences. Line Chart : Display your data as a Line Chart for fields of type number . The x-axis displays the field value, and the y-axis displays the number of users with a given value. Example : the Line Chart below shows the distribution of users with an Affinity for Candles. Pie Chart : Pie Charts are particularly useful for categorical fields (ie string, []string types). Example: the Pie Chart below shows the number of Rewards Users across 2 Audiences. Table : the Table view presents categorical or numeric data in a table format. Example: the table below shows the most common _UTM Sources_across 2 Audiences. Stats : the Stats view displays statistical information for numeric fields. Example: the table below shows the mean, min, max, standard deviation and number of users across two different Audiences. Managing Composition Components: Once you've created a Composition component, the bottom navigation bar allows you to customize your component. Here, you can select your desired chart type, toggle between stacked and unstacked charts, download data, and customize your component. Stacked : depending on the chart type, selecting the Stacked option will display the data on different charts. The image below shows an \"unstacked\" Bar Chart.

    "content": "Klaviyo Suggest Edits Overview Klaviyo is an email marketing platform created for online businesses — featuring powerful email and SMS marketing automation. Integrating Lytics with Klaviyo allows you to import user profiles and email campaign activity data (such as opens and clicks). You can also export users based on audience membership in real-time for use in email campaigns. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up a Klaviyo account before you begin the process described below. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. There are two ways you can connect Lytics and Klaviyo: Klaviyo API Key Klaviyo OAuth Sign-In Klaviyo API Key You would need Klaviyo private api key in order to use this authorization.

Export Audiences Exporting Lytics audiences to Klaviyo allows you to enhance your Klaviyo user base with new users or update existing users with cross-channel data from Lytics. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration - Audience Trigger Integration Frequency : Real-time Integration with an optional one-time Backfill of the audience after job setup. Resulting data : Lytics users that are members of the selected audiences are exported to Klaviyo and added to the selected list. Lytics users can be exported to an existing list or a new list. Only known users (with an email) are exported. This integration utilizes the Klaviyo API to send users to a list in Klaviyo. Once the export is started, the job will: Check if an existing list was selected . If not, create a new list with the name provided in the configuration. If no name is provided, create a new list with the name format Lytics {Date} . Run a backfill by creating or updating existing users in Klaviyo. Users will be subscribed to a list by default. Otherwise, users are force added to a list . After a backfill, the job will receive real-time updates when a user enters or exits the audience. For each user entering the selected audience(s), the job will create or update the user in Klaviyo and by default subcribe the user or force add the user to the Klaviyo list. Only known users with valid email identifiers are included in the export. For each user exiting the selected audience(s), the job will remove the user from the selected list. 🚧 Larger audiences may take a few days to be completely added to a list due to Klaviyo API limitations. Fields By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Klaviyo: Lytics User Field Description Klaviyo Field Type email Email Address Email string In addition to the default fields, you can export a number of Lytics user fields to Klaviyo fields .

Build an Audience of High Value Purchasers in Lytics For purchase data, this example uses an account that has been connected with Shopify data via Lytics' Shopify import. You may be importing your purchase data to Lytics via some other method such as the Javascript Tag, CSV, or one of our other commerce integrations. When building your audience the custom rule you choose may differ for your account. Follow the steps outlined in this guide to build source audiences in Lytics. The steps that follow in this guide provide specific instructions on constructing a high value purchasers audience. In the audience builder, select Custom Rule .

    "content": "Creating Templates Using the UI Suggest Edits Creating Templates Clicking the + Create New button will open a wizard that will guide you through creating a new Template. The first step involves selecting a Name, Description, Data-Type, and Template-Type. The Data-Type allows you to select the type of data used by the Template,  either User or Event (the default option is User ). The Template-Type configures the type of templating language used by the Template, either Jsonnet or Handlebars.js . After clicking Next , you will be guided to the Template configuration page where you must first select the type of Sample Data used by the Template. If the User data-type was selected, you will see a dummy user comprised of all of the fields in the user schema, or the option to search for a user. If the Event data-type was selected in the previous step, the Sample Data will be populated by a recent event from the selected stream. Once the Sample Data has been selected, Step 2 involves specifying your desired JSON structure for your destination in the Template Co-Pilot text box. Consider the example below where we specify the structure of our JSON payload, with fields such as _uid , last_active_ts , last_name , and pillowcase_affinity (derived from the lytics_content field). We are also using the Find a User feature to populate the Sample Data. Note: this example is using the Additional Prompt text box to assist the Co-Pilot in generating the template. Here we are instructing the Co-Pilot to use the lytics_content field to derive the pillowcase_affinity template field. Once Generate Template has been clicked, the text box in (3) will populate with the template. With the previous example, the following template has been generated: The Template contains all of the data specified in Step 2, and the Output to the right shows the Template applied to the Sample Data. We can see that the pillowcase_affinity was derived from the lytics_content field, as well as the other fields specified in the Template. Updated 3 months ago Table of Contents Creating Templates",

    "content": "AdRoll Suggest Edits Overview Connecting Lytics and AdRoll allows you to leverage Lytics Audiences in your AdRoll campaigns. When a visitor accesses your site Lytics identifies who they are and what Audiences they are currently a member of. This information is passed to AdRoll via the AdRoll SmartPixel, which is tied to the campaigns within your AdRoll account. As a result, your ads can target audiences based on any aspect of Lytics audiences such as behavioral scores or content affinity, in real-time. Before You Begin Ensure you have installed the Lytics JavaScript Tag. This is required in order to identify your web visitors and pass the audiences they are currently a member of to AdRoll in real-time. Access to an Admin username & password in Adroll is required in order to enable the usage of Lytics Audiences within AdRoll. An AdRoll SmartPixel ID is required in order to properly target the correct account. The steps outlined below will walk you through how to obtain this ID if you do not already have it handy. Authentication First, you need to authorize Lytics to use your AdRoll account. Log into your Lytics account . Open AdRoll integration or Click Data > Integrations and select AdRoll from the integrations list. Click Authorizations . Click Add new authorization . In the Admin Username box, enter your AdRoll admin username. In the Admin Password box, enter your AdRoll admin password. In the Account Pixel box, enter your AdRoll SmartPixel ID. - Your ID can be found within your SmartPixel. Access that pixel by following AdRoll's documentation . Once you have the pixel pulled up your ID can be found following adroll_pix_id= in your pixel tag. In the Description box, enter any description. Click Authorize to save the authorization. Share Lytics Audience Definitions with AdRoll Summary Frequency Once, Daily starting from original start time. Campaign content None Log into your Lytics account . Click Data > Integrations and select AdRoll from the integrations list. Click the AdRoll Segment Sync tab. Identify the authorization you would like to use and click Select . Determine if you would like to keep the audiences in Lytics and AdRoll in sync. If not, ensure the \"Keep Updated\" option is deselected. Click the Start Export tab. Lytics will begin adding Audiences to AdRoll immediately but it may take a few minutes to see all audiences depending on total number. Configure the Lytics JavaScript Tag to Share Visitor Audiences with AdRoll in Real-time Summary Frequency Real-time By default the Lytics JavaScript tag will pass the audiences a current visitor is a member of to AdRoll if the AdRoll SmartPixel is found on the site with the proper ID. If for any reason you would like to prevent the Lytics JavaScript tag from passing data to AdRoll, you can do so by adding AdRoll to the list of blocked integrations in your [account settings](/documentation/product/features/account-management/editing-your-account#tag). Configure your AdRoll Campaign to Use a Lytics Audience Log into your AdRoll account . Select Create Campaign . Click Websites & Apps to get started. Click Audience and then Choose at the top right. Select one or more audiences from the list and then click Choose . Continue on with your standard ad selection or creation process.

Export Audiences Export Lytics audiences to Mapp to add behavior-rich attributes to your Mapp user base including Lytics behavioral scores, content affinities, and cross-channel data. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration - Audience Trigger Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration with option to run an initial Backfill . Resulting data : A group-level attribute is added to each user in Mapp. The name of the attribute is equal to the Mapp Attribute Name or the name of the Lytics audience if left empty. The attribute value is \"true\" if the user is in the audience or \"false\" if the user has exited the audience. The attribute name must be a pre-existing attribute in your Mapp account that is mapped for use with Mapp Connect. This integration utilizes the Mapp Rest API to export users. Once the export is started the job will: As users enter or exit the Lytics audience, the users' group-level audience attribute will be added or updated to \"true\" or \"false.\" If you select the Existing Users option during the Configuration , users who currently exist in the selected Lytics audience will be immediately exported to Mapp. If you opt for a one-time export by selecting the Backfill Only option during the Configuration , the job will stop after sending the existing users in the audience. Otherwise, these updates occur continuously as the Lytics audience membership changes.

(optional) In the Mapp Attribute Name text box, enter enter the name of the Mapp user attribute to update profiles with. If this is empty, the workflow will attempt to use the Lytics audience slug as the attribute name. Note that unless Enable Dynamic Attributes is selected, this attribute name must be mapped to an existing member attribute in Mapp Connect. Select the Existing Users checkbox to immediately push users who currently exist in the selected Lytics audience. Deselecting will only push users as they leave or enter the audience. (optional) Select the Backfill Only checkbox, to do a one-time export of the selected audience. Note that if this option is selected, Existing Users must also be selected. Click Start Export . Export Audiences (SFTP) The SFTP Export allows you to export your Lytics audiences to an SFTP server in a CSV format, which can then be consumed by Mapp and used to create lists. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : File Based Transfer Integration . Frequency : Batch Integration daily at a specified time, or once only. Resulting data : User Field s are written to a file. New users are added to subsequent file uploads, and no users are removed. This integration utilizes the SSH File Transfer Protocol to send user data. The file name needs to be formatted as follows: export-lytics-{audience name}-{timestamp}.csv . This will be transferred to the SFTP server and the file needs to contain headers in a format readable by Mapp. Once the export is started the job will: Scan the audience for all currently existing members. Write the users and any mapped fields to a CSV file. Upload the CSV file to the user-specified SFTP server. If Keep Updated is selected in the configuration process, steps 1-3 will occur daily at the defined time. Fields By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Mapp. Lytics User Field Description Mapp Field Type email/ID Email Address or other identifier Email string Audiences Audiences the user is a member of user.CustomAttribute.SegmentMembership comma separated list Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export of Mapp in the Lytics platform.

From the Time of Day input, select the time of day to run the export. Note this is only available if Keep Updated is selected. From the Timezone input, select the timezone for time of day. Click Start Export . Experiences Lytics Experiences supports Mapp marketing campaign single sends. This Experience can be run as stand-alone campaigns such as group emails. Experience Import Like all Experience enabled providers, you can import Experiences from Mapp to Lytics. During the import process, you will be asked to select an authorization. Read the Mapp authorization documentation for more information. Before you can import, you will need to provide the Group ID of the messages you wish to import. Once you've entered a Group ID, you can import eligible messages as Lytics Experiences. Only messages prepared or sent within the last 31 days are available via Mapp's API . Tactics Mapp Experiences in Lytics support the following tactic: Single Send - Sync a Lytics audience for a one-time email blast. The tactic for an Experience is determined by the type of email created in Mapp, single send . The import list only contains NORMAL, SPLIT_MAIN and SPLIT_TEST messages from Mapp. Configuration After importing a Mapp Experience you can configure it for activation. This tactic for Mapp Experiences has two configuration steps within the Experience Editor : Target - select the target audience for your Experience. Configure Mapp - set up how the audience for your Experience will be exported. This step will match the configuration instructions of the following jobs based on tactic: Export Audiences for Single Send tactics. The activation will generally function the same as the corresponding job, but without the Audience selection, as that is configured by the Target step in the Experience editor. Once you've finished configuring the Experience you can save and activate it. Activation Single Send activation pushes users to a Mapp Group and functions similarly to the Export Audiences . Once exported, the experience audience can be assigned to your message in Mapp. Single Send Tactics When you activate this Experience, users will be pushed to a Mapp Group. Ensure that that your selected Group was populated in your Mapp account. Navigate to Groups . Next it's expected that you will assign this Group to your Email Message. This is the message that metrics will be collected on. Proceed with the sending process once your email message is ready. Metrics Experience Metrics are collected for Mapp Experiences by launching an Experience Metrics collection workflow. Metrics are collected every hour for Mapp Messages via the Message getStatistics API . Lytics metrics are recorded using the following fields provided by the Message getStatistics API : Reach : confirmedOpener The number of confirmed people who opened your email message. Converted : uniqueClickers The number of people who performed a click. Conversion Rate : clickToOpenRate The percentage of people who open your email message and performed a unique click. These events are also mapped to the Lytics user fields Reached with Mapp Experience and Converted on Mapp Experience , which are available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have been reached by or converted on your Mapp Experiences.

The Basics Import Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of: Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system. Gathering data from an external system and ingesting it in Lytics on sensible data streams. Handling errors and \"retry\" logic. Determining the cadence at which the job should run again. Similarly, Export Jobs are managed by Lytics and are responsible for automating, where applicable, the process of: Authenticating and managing a connection to an external system. Gathering data like user attributes, audiences or events from Lytics and exporting it to an external system. Handling errors and \"retry\" logic. Determining the cadence at which the job should run again. Adding a new Job New data import Jobs are added from the Conductor interface by first navigating to the Jobs section under the Pipeline section in the main navigation. From there, you'll click \"+ Create New\" at the top of the list and enter the wizard to guide you through the creation process. Configuring a Job Select a Provider Each Job is first categorized by the provider, making it easy to narrow down the channel you'd like to integrate with. To select a provider, click the tile representing your desired provider, such as \"Google.\" Select Job Type With the provider selected, we'll surface the various ways you can integrate with that particular provider. This will vary significantly by the provider. Select Authorization Method Each provider and job type may require additional authorization to finalize the connection. On the \"select authorization\" step, you can either select an existing authorization or create a new one. When creating a new authorization, you will be asked to provide the required credentials, such as key and secret, to proceed. Create New Authorization You can create it during source configuration if you lack valid authorization for your desired provider/source combination. Click \"Create new Authorization\" above the list, follow the wizard in Vault , and return to where you left off. Configure Job The final step lets you provide the specific configuration details for your chosen provider and job type. Again, the options supported by each provider will vary greatly, and provider-specific integration details should be leveraged to determine the optimal approach. Monitoring a Job Once you have one or more Source jobs running, they will be accessible from the Source list view, as pictured below. This view provides quick access to essential details: Name : Name of job, such as \"Export of High-Value Users to Facebook.\" Authorization : Name of the associated authorization. Provider : Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics. Type : Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment. Status : Current state of a job such as running, paused, completed, etc. Created : Date the job was initially created. Job Status Detailed states are provided to understand better what is happening in the background during a job's lifecycle. These states will vary by job but include: Job Status Description Running The job is actively running. Sleeping The job is not actively running but is scheduled to run again after a given period. A job is sleeping either because the job runs on a periodic cadence with scheduled sleep in between job runs or the job has encountered an error and is sleeping before retrying the request. Failed The job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again. Check the logs to see if there are any fixable issues. Failed works can be resumed, which will schedule it to run again. Failed jobs will be automatically purged after 90 days. Paused A user has paused the job. The work can be scheduled to run again by resuming the job. Paused works will be automatically purged after 90 days. Completed The job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun. These will be purged from the job history after 90 days. For more information on job states or troubleshooting failed jobs, see job processing . Job Summary Clicking on any of the items in the Source list will navigate to its dedicated summary view for greater detail. This summary provides all the relevant information about each job you've created in Lytics and an entry point to alter the configuration or status. At the top of the Job Summary page, you’ll find the following quick-access information: Status : Indicates the current state of a job. See the table below for descriptions of each status. Provider : Third-party tool that you are connecting with Lytics, such as Facebook, Google, Mailchimp, etc. Type : Indicates whether the job is an import, export, or enrichment. Job Name : Name of the job, such as “Import Users & Activity” or “Export Audiences.” Authorization : Name of the authorization, such as “Main Salesforce auth.” Created By : Lytics user who created the authorization. Last Updated : Date the job was most recently edited. 📘 You can edit the name and description of an existing job from its summary page to improve the organization and clarity of your account's list of jobs. Metrics The activity chart will provide metrics (if available) on a job's performance to give a better understanding of how your data is flowing in and out of Lytics. You can see the number of profiles the job added, removed, or omitted during the selected time frame. Note this feature is currently in development. Once metrics are available for each job, this chart will become populated. Configuration The configuration section displays a JSON view of your job's current configuration. This includes details such as the authorization used, where data is coming from, which data is being pulled in, etc. Logs The Logs section records the history of events for this job, details about the work completed, and the time each job was run. The logs are helpful to ensure your work is running as expected and for troubleshooting if any issues arise. Below are descriptions of the job events you may see in the logs. Job Events Description Started The job has started running for the first time. Synced The job has completed a unit of work successfully and will continue to run. Error The job has encountered an error and will retry automatically. Sleeping The job is currently sleeping due to external restrictions, such as hitting a provider's API limits. Failed The job has encountered consecutive errors over 10 hours and is removed from running again. Completed The job has completed all its scheduled tasks and will not be rerun. Backfilling Data Some use cases involve having historical data available for segmentation.  This data might be demographic in nature, or describe how customers prefer to be contacted. This document offers guidelines for cases where large amounts of this data must be available in your Lytics account. Best Practices Separate Backfill from Real-time Streams A real-time data stream contains messages sent in response to the activity they describe. This is distinguished from batched data streams, where messages are sent in groups on a given schedule or according to another trigger. For attributes that will be kept updated by a real-time stream, there is the additional requirement to populate that attribute with a substantial amount of pre-existing information, separating that backfilling from now-forward messages. Backfill messages can be sent using multiple means. API loads should be sent via the bulk CSV or bulk JSON endpoints. It is also possible to use integration workflows to import this data, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 . The benefit of separating this data from real-time message streams is that the processing of backfill messages does not impact the processing time of messages received from real-time streams. The bulk imports are processed in parallel to real-time messages. This means that marketing activations reliant on real-time updates are not affected. Utilize Timestamps Whenever possible, all messages should have an explicit timestamp. While all messages are additionally time stamped by Lytics at the time of ingestion, specifying a message timestamp is helpful in all circumstances, particularly in cases when messages are received out of order so that Lytics knows which one is the most up-to-date.  It is essential when a backfill occurs concurrently with a real-time stream of the same attribute. All means of loading data permit specifying timestamps. Via API, this is via a timestamp_field URL parameter. In the Admin UI, data import configuration options feature a menu to pick among the file schema for a timestamp field. Evaluate Necessity All messages imported into your Lytics account are stored in their raw form and represented as profile attributes in the graph. The purpose of storing all messages is to enable the reprocessing of those messages, a process called rebuilding . Rebuilding enables all received messages to be represented differently with different attributes, identity resolution rules, etc. All data ingested into Lytics incrementally increase the overhead of rebuilding, making it a longer and more processing-intensive operation. Therefore, before importing large amounts of data, consider the value/benefit of that data. If there is no clear use case for backfilling, consider skipping it.

    "title": "Get Started with Lytics Segments",
    "content": "Get Started with Lytics Segments Suggest Edits Get Started with Lytics Segments Lets take an in-depth look at Lytics segments. We'll cover how to define a segment with SegmentQL or SegmentAST, as well as the Segment API endpoints to create, read, update, delete, scan, and list the segments in your account. Note that throughout this guide we use the term segment and audience interchangably. Specifically, the term audience refers to a segment on the user table. In your Lytics account there is also a separate table and schema for content. A segment on this table is often called a content collection. Difficulty Beginner TLDR: Checkout the Segment API documentation . Other resources: Lytics Go Client - Lytics API library for the go programming language. QLBridge - a go SQL Runtime Engine. Lytics Segment Scan with SQL . Prerequisites httpie - (optional) a more user friendly version of cURL that we'll be using in this guide for readability. Lytics Command Line Tool - (optional) we'll show you how to execute commands with our CLI for each endpoint that is supported. A valid API token for your Lytics account ( learn about managing API tokens ). For ease of use we suggest adding as an environment variable in your command line: Bash export LIOKEY={API Token} 1. Defining A Segment If you haven't yet, take a minute to check out the audience builder in your account. This can be accessed from the Audience tab in the Lytics UI and then by selecting to create a new audience . The audience builder is a visual interface for what we will cover in the first section of this guide - defining a segment. A segment definition at its core is really just a conditional statement. If the data we have collected on a user meets the conditions of the segment than they are considered a member. We have two different syntaxes for these conditional segment definitions: SegmentQL, and SegmentAST. SegmentQL SegmentQL is simple Query Language using filter statements. Before we dive too deep into the syntax, lets look at a segment built in the segment builder UI side by side with its SegmentQL definition. FILTER OR (\n  AND (\n    cm_status = \"active\"\n    INCLUDE last_open_7_days\n  )\n  last_active_ts > \"now-7d\"\n)\nFROM user \nALIAS active_web_or_email In this example cm_status refers to the subscriber status in Campaign Monitor, an email provider. So a marketer might build this audience as a target for all users who are active across their email and web channels in the last 7 days. For us developers, this simple query language is probably quite intuitive! Our UI exists for marketers to build audiences, but you might find it quicker to write SegmentQL, and create a segment through the API. Just to cover all our bases lets take an in depth look at the anatomy of a filter statement: FILTER [phrase] [from] [alias] [phrase] Notes AND ([phrase], [phrase], ...) OR ([phrase], [phrase], ...) NOT [phrase] EXISTS [identifier] [identifier] is a field name. [identifier] IN ([literal], [literal], ...) [identifier] CONTAINS [literal] [identifier] INTERSECTS ([literal], [literal], ...) INTERSECTS = \"contains one of\" [identifier] LIKE [literal] [literal] must be a string. Can use * a wildcard INCLUDE [identifier] [identifier] is a segment id/slug. (to include existing segment) [identifier] > [literal] [identifier] >= [literal] [identifier] < [literal] [identifier] <= [literal] [identifier] = [literal] [identifier] != [literal] [identifier] = alphanumeric string (often the name of a data field, table, or segment). [literal] = a string, int, float, boolean, or timestamp literal value. [from] Notes FROM [identifier] [identifier] is the name of the table ie. user , content , etc. [from] is optional if creating a filter on the user table. [alias] Notes ALIAS [identifier] [identifier] is the saved name of the segment. [alias] is optional if you do not wish to save the segment. Segment AST SegmentAST expressions look very similar to SegmentQL but instead of having its own filter syntax it is formatted in JSON. It's perhaps less readable for a human, but if you're writing a program which creates or updates segment definitions it might be easier to format the bodies of your requests using SegmentAST. Lets look at the same example from above in SegmentAST. JSON {\n  \"op\": \"or\",\n    \"args\": [{\n    \"op\": \"and\",\n    \"args\": [{\n      \"op\": \"=\",\n      \"args\": [{\n        \"ident\": \"cm_status\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"val\": \"active\"\n      }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"op\": \"include\",\n      \"args\": [{\n        \"ident\": \"last_open_7_days\"\n      }]\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \">\",\n    \"args\": [{\n      \"ident\": \"last_active_ts\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"val\": \"now-7d\"\n    }]\n  }]\n} Definitely not as easy to look at as SegmentQL, but if you spend a second scanning the JSON that you'll see it's generally the same expressions. Here is a breakdown of the key components: key type Notes op string operator used to evaluate the args args array a list of objects containing the identifiers and literals operate on ident string identifier name val string literal value 2. Segment Validate API The segment validate endpoint accepts a plain text SegmentQL statement and ensures that the definition is valid. This can be especially useful when creating a segment. Before sending a request to build the segment via the API you might want to validate it first. Shell echo 'FILTER AND (\n  utm_campaigns CONTAINS \"summer_froyo_promo\",\n  EXISTS email,\n  scores.momentum > 40\n)' | http POST https://api.lytics.io/api/segment/validate access_token==$LIOKEY Note that this endpoint does not validate field names in your account. It simply checks the syntax of the SegmentQL statement. 3. Segment CRUD API Segment Create The segment create endpoint accepts plain text (containing SegmentQL) or a JSON body (SegmentQL or AST). Bash # example 1: plain text\necho 'FILTER (\n  lytics_content.Yogurt >= 0.75\n)\nFROM user \nALIAS affinity_for_yogurt\n' | http POST https://api.lytics.io/api/segment Content-type:text/plain access_token==$LIOKEY Bash # example 2: json segmentQL\necho '{\n  \"name\": \"High Affinity for Yogurt\",\n  \"segment_ql\": \"FILTER (lytics_content.Yogurt >= 0.75)\",\n  \"slug_name\": \"affinity_for_yogurt\",\n  \"is_public\": true,\n  \"description\": \"Segment containing all users highly interested in the topic Yogurt.\",\n  \"table\": \"user\"\n\n}' | http POST https://api.lytics.io/api/segment Content-type:application/json access_token==$LIOKEY Bash # example 3: json segmentAST\necho '{\n  \"name\": \"High Affinity for Yogurt\",\n  \"slug_name\": \"affinity_for_yogurt\",\n  \"is_public\": true,\n  \"description\": \"Segment containing all users highly interested in the topic Yogurt.\",\n  \"table\": \"user\",\n  \"ast\": {\n    \"op\": \">=\",\n    \"args\": [{\n      \"ident\": \"lytics_content.Yogurt\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"val\": \"0.75\"\n    }]\n  }\n\n}' | http POST https://api.lytics.io/api/segment Content-type:application/json access_token==$LIOKEY Segment Read You must know the segment ID or slug name to fetch the segment via the read endpoint. Bash # example 1:\nhttp GET https://api.lytics.io/api/segment/affinity_for_yogurt access_token==$LIOKEY Bash # example 2: lytics cli\nlytics --segments=affinity_for_yogurt segment Segment Update You must know the ID or the slug of the segment to update. Bash echo '{\n  \"slug_name\": \"affinity_for_yogurt\",\n  \"segment_ql\": \"FILTER (lytics_content.Yogurt >= 0.9)\"\n}' | http PUT https://api.lytics.io/api/segment/affinity_for_yogurt access_token==$LIOKEY Segment Delete You must know the ID or the slug of the segment to delete. Bash http DELETE https://api.lytics.io/api/segment/affinity_for_yogurt access_token==$LIOKEY 4. Segment List API For many of the CRUD operations we just talked about you need to know the ID or slug name of the segment. It may help to have access to a list of all existing segments in your account to use as a reference. The list endpoint will return a list of all segments for your account including id, slug, and the QL and/or AST definition of the segment. Bash # example 1: list all audiences\nhttp GET https://api.lytics.io/api/segment access_token==$LIOKEY Bash # example 2: lytics cli\nlytics segment Bash # example 3: list all content collections\nhttp GET https://api.lytics.io/api/segment access_token==$LIOKEY table==content 5. Segment Scan API The scan endpoint provides a list of all entities in a segment. For audiences (segments on the user table) the entities returned are user profiles. The scan endpoint can accept a number of different query parameters, we won't cover all of them here, but as always you can check out our docs for the full details on this API. You can use this endpoint to scan an existing, saved segment in which case you'll need the segment ID or slug. You can also scan an ad-hoc segment by passing SegmentQL to the endpoint. Bash # example 1: existing audience\nhttp GET https://api.lytics.io/api/segment/affinity_for_yogurt/scan access_token==$LIOKEY ortfield==last_purchase_ts Bash # example 2: lytics cli\nlytics --id=affinity_for_yogurt segmentscan Bash # example 3: ad-hoc content collection\necho 'FILTER OR (\n  global.Yogurt > 0.5,\n  global.`Ice Cream` > 0.5\n)\nFROM content\n' | http GET https://api.lytics.io/api/segment/scan access_token==$LIOKEY limit==10 Bash # example 4: ad-hoc lytics cli\nlytics segmentscan '\nFILTER (\n  aspects INTERSECTS (\"article\", \"video\")\n)\nFROM content' If the total number of entities in the segment exceeds the limit provided in the request (the default value is 20) then we will paginate the results. In the JSON body, there will be a token value with the key next . To get the next page of results in the scan, make a subsequent request with the query param start equal to the next token from the prior request. The API will continue to return next tokens in each response until you've fully scaned the segment. What's next? The endpoints we covered here will get you started with Lytics segments. We do have a couple segment APIs that were not covered in this guide, primarily around segment size. The API for this is quite simple, check out our docs if you're interested. It also may help to look at the catalog schema and/or the query API if you're unfamiliar with the fields in your Lytics account. Keep in mind that everything you see in the Lytics web UI is built off of our APIs. It is never \"necessary\" to use the UI to complete a task with Lytics. If you have the time and resources you can build many different custom applications to interface with your Lytics account through our APIs. We're excited to work with developers to tackle exciting new use cases. If our docs aren't enough you can always reach out to us .

Paste your New Relic API key into the Insights API Key textbox. Also enter a description for the authorization in the Description box. Click Authorize to save the credentials. Export Metrics to New Relic Insights Summary Frequency Metrics are written out every 60 seconds. Exports to Insights Custom Events You can choose to export incoming events metrics, audience change metrics, or user metrics to Insights for alerting and monitoring. 📘 The name of the metrics listed in metrics doc will have a prefix value of lytics__ in front of each _eventType . Example: JSON [\n  {\n    \"eventType\": \"lytics_monitoring_heartbeat\",\n    \"eventSource\": \"LyticsMonitoring\",\n    \"eventTime\": \"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00\",\n    \"account\":\"test123\",\n    \"value\": 1\n  }\n] In Lytics, navigate to the New Relic integration in integrations. Click Export Monitoring Metrics . Select the authorization you created in the authorization step . In the New Relic Account ID textbox, enter the ID of your account. You can get this ID from the URL of \"Account Settings\" in New Relic. Click Start Export . You should see metrics coming in as custom events into your Insights account after setting up this integration. Alerting Examples Once the export has started and some data has been collected on the New Relic side, you can use the data to create alerts within New Relic . For instance, using the Lytics Monitoring Heartbeat metric , you can create an alert if the service happens to be interrupted. The following alert(s) are just examples, Lytics recommend building in some buffers so alerts don't begin to go off for simple network issues. In this case we'll issue a warning if the query returns less than 1 for 5 minutes and a full alert if we see less than 1 for 15 minutes. NRQL> SELECT count(value) FROM lytics_monitoring_heartbeat\n lytics_monitoring_heartbeat query result is < 1 unit for at least 15 mins\n lytics_monitoring_heartbeat query result is < 1 unit for at least 5 mins We could also create an alert to watch traffic collection which may tell us if there is an issue with the JavaScript tag on a production website. In this case if the value of collection counts falls below one, we know no data is coming into any stream so there is likely an issue. NRQL> SELECT average(value) FROM lytics_collection_count\n lytics_collection_count query result is < 1 unit for at least 40 mins\n lytics_collection_count query result is < 1 unit for at least 20 mins Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents Overview Before you begin Authentication Export Metrics to New Relic Insights Alerting Examples",

    "content": "Schema Versions Suggest Edits Introduction Schema versions allow changes to be made in advance of publishing changes directly to the pipeline.  A version combines the changes from fields , mappings , and rankings .  After making changes to fields, mappings, or rankings Since mappings occur within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline, mappings will only be applied to data that passes through the pipeline and will not be retroactively applied to historical data.  For information on creating profile attributes with data outside of Lytics collection APIs. Publishing & Reverting Schema Changes Publishing changes is easy. You can first determine if there are any unpublished changes to your schema by visiting the Versions under the Schema menu in the main navigation within Conductor. There you will see a summary of your version history and the number of unpublished changes. Publishing Changes If you have unpublished changes, click on the Publish Changes button to review those changes and ultimately publish when ready. Once you have opted to publish the changes, you will be asked to complete a final review. This review will outline the changes to fields , mappings , and rankings . On the final step, you'll have an opportunity to provide a description to associate with the version and ultimately publish. This ensures any changes have a clear history and reduces any change of accidental schema changes. Reverting Changes Discarding Unpublished Changes If you determine that you would like to discard all the current unpublished changes to the schema, click on the Discard Changes button. This will open a dialog box that will confirm that you wish to reset the schema to the last published version. Select the Discard Changes button to discard all changes. Reverting Published Changes If you would like to remove the changes you published in your most recent schema version(s), navigate to the version you would like to return your schema to and click the Revert to Schema button. This will create a new unpublished version that contains all the changes needed to return all the fields, mappings and ranks back to the state of the desired schema version. Your will then need to publish these changes in order to complete the reversion.

    "title": "LQL & Data Import Basics",
    "content": "LQL & Data Import Basics Suggest Edits LQL & Data Import Basics Let's take an in-depth look at Lytics Query Language (LQL) and custom data imports. We'll cover a basic overview of LQL itself, how data identities are resolved across streams, how you can map custom data and finally a few of the different ways to import custom data into your account. Difficulty : Intermediate TLDR: Checkout the data upload documentation and the query documentation . Prerequisites httpie - (optional) a more user friendly version of cURL that we'll be using in this guide for readability. Lytics Command Line Tool - (optional) we'll show you how to execute commands with our CLI for each endpoint that is supported. A valid API token for your Lytics account ( learn about managing API tokens ). For ease of use we suggest adding as an environment variable in your command line: Bash export LIOKEY={API Token} 1. Lytics Data Processing Review Due to the intermediate nature of this course it is important that you already possess a strong understanding of segmentation, user fields and data streams. For those new to the Lytics data pipeline we recommend reviewing the following documentation before proceeding with the rest of the steps: Introduction: Lytics Data Collection Introduction: Lytics User Profiles & User Fields Introduction: Lytics Audiences 2. Sending Data from a Website (JavaScript) When the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed we will automatically begin collecting standard data. This includes page-view level information such as URL, browser, Lytics Cookie Id, etc. In addition to the standard page-view event the Lytics tag empowers marketers to push more sophisticated data related to the end user's behavior or identity. An example of such data to a custom stream called custom_data might look something like: JavaScript jstag.send('custom_data', {\n  userid: \"1234\",\n  email: \" [email protected] \",\n  first_name: \"Jon\",\n  last_name: \"Snow\",\n  title: \"King in the North\",\n  company: \"House Stark\",\n  phone: \"555-555-5555\",\n  age: 21,\n  gender: \"m\",\n  city: \"Winterfell\",\n  state: \"Westeros\",\n  status: \"planning\"\n}); While visiting your site that has the Lytics JavaScript tag installed you can leverage Chrome's developer tools, specifically the console, to manually fire this \"send\" request and pass the payload above to Lytics. Keep in mind, all data sent from your browser will automatically be associated with your current cookie. When testing and playing it is best practice to always use a fresh incognito browser. Chrome tools has great documentation if they are new to you as well. Check out our JavaScript tag data collection docs for more details on the power of the Lytics tag. 3. What is LQL? Lytics Query Language(LQL) is the transformation layer that makes passing arbitrary, non-schema specific data to Lytics. For the most basic implementations it is simply the translation of raw event data to user field data, the Lytics schema. In more advanced implementations complex calculations can be performed on events across streams to create sums, maps, and more. An example might be rolling all purchase_total values for individual conversions into a purchase_total_over_time field that holds the total revenue for that particular profile. LQL is very powerful and we recommend working directly with our services team to get the most out of it. We also have some great docs to give you some more detail on the pre-built power. As mentioned in our documentation, LQL can be broken down into 6 key components: SELECT Select data to be added to user profiles. Including Maps, Counts, and other complex data types. As an example from the above event we sent from the browser you might map status to the custom field current_status in order to unify data across streams. In that case your select statement would be something like: status     AS current_status     SHORTDESC \"Current Status of a User\" where status is the key name from the event stream and current_status is the field name that is used across multiple streams. The SHORTDESC allows you to add more context around that particular field in order to simplify working with the data inside the Lytics admin. FROM The stream to select from. In our example case this would simply be: FROM custom_data INTO This is USER for all user profiles. (technically you could create other types, such as “account”). INTO user WHERE Filters out entire records to not be included/analyzed. Bots, Employees, Test data. In our example we might want to exclude anyone not from Winterfell. WHERE \n    city = \"Winterfell\" BY What field are we going to identify this entity by. This is among the most important aspects of LQL. This defines which fields can be used as keys to merge data fragments together into a user profile. For instance: BY email OR userid Means that anytime an email address or userid matches, regardless of its origin, we can assume that is the same user, thus merging all data associated with that key. ALIAS The alias is primarily an internal value of how to reference this particular LQL statement. When accessing LQL through the UI it would be referenced by this alias: ALIAS custom_lql_example 4. Writing LQL Now that we know the basics of LQL we can put it all together in such a way that our sample data sent can be mapped into user fields. Though this can be totally customized to your liking the end product might look something like: /*\n    Custom User Data Example\n*/\nSELECT\n\n    userid             AS user_id          SHORTDESC \"Users ID\"\n    , email            AS email            SHORTDESC \"Email Address\"\n    , first_name       AS first_name       SHORTDESC \"First Name\"\n    , last_name        AS last_name        SHORTDESC \"Last Name\"\n    , set(title)       AS title            SHORTDESC \"Job Title\"\n    , set(company)     AS company          SHORTDESC \"Company Name\"\n    , phone            AS phone            SHORTDESC \"Phone Number\"\n    , age              AS age              SHORTDESC \"Age\"                KIND INT\n    , gender           AS gender           SHORTDESC \"Gender\"\n    , city             AS city             SHORTDESC \"City\"\n    , state            AS state            SHORTDESC \"State\"\n    , status           AS status           SHORTDESC \"Current Status\"\n\nFROM custom_data\nINTO user BY email OR user_id\nALIAS custom_data_example All that is left once we have completed writing is to save our LQL file. This file name is completely up to you but should end with .lql . This will simplify the next step when we test our LQL before uploading it to our account. 5. Testing LQL Install Lytics CLI Now that we have our LQL saved locally using the .lql extension we are ready to test. To test we will use the Lytics CLI tool. The CLI tool and installation instructions can be found on Github . Once we have installed the CLI tool lets verify it is working properly. In the terminal of your choice run the following command(s): Bash $ lytics -h If you are presented with a help menu you are good to go, if an error comes back or something was not found we recommend going through the CLI tools docs again to get it properly configured. Create a Sample CSV The Lytics CLI can test LQL in two ways. First, it will read some of the recent events from the target stream and show you the processed output. This is valuable when it comes to altering existing LQL but may present challenges when you are writing net new LQL on data that has not been sent to Lytics yet. For that use case we'll generate a CSV file to read from locally. In addition, though not demonstrated here, Lytics watch can also use a JSON file locally in addition to the CSV. CSV's can be created using a variety of tools. When creating your own CSV from scratch just ensure that the first row in the CSV is used to define your field keys(headers) and then each following row represents an individual user's data. _created _modified user_id email first_name last_name title company phone age gender city state status 2017-07-27T03:04:04.960952144Z 2017-07-27T03:04:04.960952144Z 1234 [email protected] Jon Snow King in the North House Stark 555-555-5555 21 m Winterfell Westeros planning When saving your CSV ensure the file name matches that of your lql with .csv in place of .lql . For instance if your LQL file is named my_sample_file.lql your CSV should be named my_sample_file.csv and be located in the same directory. The Lytics CLI will look for CSVs with the same file name as your LQL file. Activate Lytics Watch Lytics watch will listen for changes to your LQL file. When that happens it will take the CSV or recent data from your stream and process it using that newly altered LQL. This translation is then output into your terminal in order to validate that all mappings are working properly. JSON {\n  \"_created\": \"2017-07-27T03:04:04.960952144Z\",\n  \"_modified\": \"2017-07-27T03:04:04.960952144Z\",\n  \"user_id\": \"1234\",\n  \"email\": \" [email protected] \",\n  \"first_name\": \"Jon\",\n  \"last_name\": \"Snow\",\n  \"title\": \"King in the North\",\n  \"company\": \"House Stark\",\n  \"phone\": \"555-555-5555\",\n  \"age\": 21,\n  \"gender\": \"m\",\n  \"city\": \"Winterfell\",\n  \"state\": \"Westeros\",\n  \"status\": \"planning\"\n} 6. Uploading LQL to an Account NOTE: Please be sure you are using the correct API token when performing the next operation. To check which API you currently have set simply run the following in your terminal: Shell $ echo $LIOKEY The value output should match the API token pulled from your account. If this is not the case please revisit the prerequisites section above for setting up you API token. Query POST Request To upload the query you will make a simple POST request to our API. Upon a successful upload you will get a response of 200 . Lytics handles everything else from there. Bash $ https POST https://api.lytics.io/api/query access_token==$LIOKEY < my_custom_lql_file_name.lql 7. Importing a CSV Finally we can import our CSV using a standard cURL command. Be sure to update your file and stream name in the example below: Bash curl -s -H \"Authorization: $LIOKEY\" \\\n  -H 'Content-type: application/csv' \\\n  --data-binary @your_file_name.csv \\\n  \"https://bulk.lytics.io/collect/bulk/your_stream_name\" What's next? We've covered a basic example of getting custom data into Lytics. This is very much just the beginning of how LQL can help improve your marketing teams efficiency. We invite you to explore all of our technical docs and reach out to our services team for more in-depth training on LQL and data management!

    "title": "Cloud Connect Troubleshooting and FAQs",
    "content": "Cloud Connect Troubleshooting and FAQs Suggest Edits Syncs What is a “sync” in the context of Cloud Connect? A sync refers to the process of running SQL queries configured on Data Models against data warehouses and then updating Lytics profiles with any changes that have occurred since the previous sync. Will my SQL query only be run once per sync? Most of the time, yes. However, if an interruption occurs during the sync (either due to a processing or network error), we’ll attempt to resume the sync from the place where we left off. If that occurs, we’ll need to rerun the query. Why are the sync times slightly different than what I’d expect? On the Data Model Details page, we display two timestamps related to the sync for your Data Model: “Last Sync on” and “Next Sync On”. The “Last Sync On” timestamp displays the exact time when your Data Model was last synced. However, the timestamp shown for “Next Sync On” will vary slightly from the time when your model will actually sync. In an effort to reduce the number of syncs needed, we set the “Next Sync On” timestamp in a way where more models will end up synced together. Then every hour, we check to see which models are ready to sync - if “Next Sync on” is in the past, we sync the model. Ultimately, you should think of your selected sync frequency as the number of times per day your model will sync (e.g. a model with a sync frequency of four hours will sync six times per day). The “Next Sync on” timestamp gives an estimate as to when the next sync will occur rather than the exact time. Data Models Why can’t I create a Data Model that returns no rows? We use the columns returned by the SQL query to set up our internal schema. If no data is returned by the query, we don’t have the required information to correctly set up our schema. Note that once the schema is set up, your Data Model will continue to sync regardless of how many rows are returned. Why can’t I create/update a Data Model when my schema has unpublished changes? Creating a Data Model modifies your Conductor schema - at a minimum, a true/false “membership” field will be added to denote whether a profile falls into that Data Model. In addition, one field is added for each activated field that’s selected. In order for these fields to be added, your Conductor schema cannot be in a draft state. When updating a Data Model, we’ll attempt to update your Conductor schema if any activated fields are being changed. For this reason, if you try to edit your activated fields and your schema has unpublished changes, we’ll reject the update. Can I select any field as the primary key? The UI allows for selecting any column that’s returned by your SQL query as your primary key. However, it’s important that the selected primary key field contain unique values. If there are duplicate values, we cannot guarantee that the values for your activated fields will be correct. You should choose a field whose values will match to the values of an existing “by” field in your Lytics schema. Can I select any field as the Lytics key? No; only “by” fields can be selected. Further, once a Data Model has been created for a certain primary key, all subsequent Data Models which use that primary key must also use that same Lytics key. Sync Failures Related To Collation Cloud Connect requires that the column you use as the primary key of your data model queries be UTF-8 collated. If your column is collated differently, this can cause your data model syncs to fail. Most database providers allow columns to be converted to a particular collation within a query. If your primary key column is collated differently, consult the documentation of your database provider to ensure a compatible collation: Snowflake BigQuery Azure RedShift Updated 10 months ago Table of Contents Syncs What is a “sync” in the context of Cloud Connect?

    "title": "Jebbit",
    "content": "Jebbit Suggest Edits Overview The following document outlines the recommended pattern for ensuring all information collected via Jebbit can be associated with the fully resolved C360 profiles built and managed by Lytics. This document will cover the core mechanics of what is happening and instructions on achieving an initial implementation. 📘 It is always recommended that you consult with the technical resources responsible for managing your web properties to ensure no existing implementations or usecases are negatively impacted by added additional code via tag manager or directly to your code base. Pulling this use case together requires the following three milestones: Identify the end user during a website visit. Hand off the identity information, Lytics _uid, to Jebbit to leverage inside of their managed properties. Complete the survey or other Jebbit-managed interaction. Deliver all interaction data back to Lytics to be associated with the origin user's profile. Configuration Identify the Visitor Identifying the visitor is simple and comes out of the box as part of the installation of our Javascript SDK . By installing this tag, we'll automatically place a first-party cookie on the visitor's device specific to Lytics. This cookie contains the Lytics _uid , which enables associating interactions across your site with a single C360 profile. In our handoff to Jebbit below, we'll leverage one of the many available utilities to access and deliver this value per Jebbits preferred method. Hand off UID to Jebbit There are several ways that Jebbit can be leveraged. This document outlines the recommended path for using an iFrame embed for your Jebbit Experiences. If you are using an alternate method, consult the Jebbit documentation. However, a similar approach can be used across all Jebbit launch methods. From the Jebbit UI, navigate to your desired experience. Along the top, you'll see a navigation option for \"launch.\" This is where you'll access the source code and configuration options for the iFrame launch method. To the right of the code snippet, you'll find a toggle for \"User ID,\" as shown below. Ensure that this is enabled, as it allows the Lytics _uid to be passed to Jebbit and associated with all tracked interactions. Finally, place the Jebbit snippet on your website as you usually would. No additional actions are necessary specific to Lytics. Further details on Jebbit's iFrame Experience launch configuration can be found here . Configure Jebbit to Lytics Connection Feeding interaction data back to Lytics in near real-time is always recommended. This is made possible via the Jebbit to Lytics integration. This integration leverages a webhook that passes data to a unique data stream for mapping into the profile. Both webhooks and the Lytics integration require assistance from the Jebbit team to configure and will require a valid access token along with the name of your desired stream. Stream definition is entirely up to you, but we recommend jebbit_activity to take advantage of a set of pre-defined mappings. Access Token Creation Though any role with the ability to create and manage data sources will work without an issue, we recommend creating a token with the Data Manager privilege exclusively for this integration. This reduces any risk of granting unnecessary access. As a result of a properly configured connection, you'll have access to all interaction data collected via Jebbit, which in most cases looks similar to the following: json {\n  \"source\": \"EmbedOnSite\",\n  \"link\": \"EmbedOnSite\",\n  \"experience_date\": \"2023-08-17 20:56:36 UTC\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2023-08-17 20:56:36 UTC\",\n  \"elapsed_time\": 8,\n  \"client_user_id\": \"sample-user-id\",\n  \"country_code\": \"US\",\n  \"jebbit_id\": \"aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa\",\n  \"page_url\": \"https://yourdomain.com/\",\n  \"url_params\": \"L=Full+Page&uid=sample-user-id&deferred=true\",\n  \"aws_region\": \"us\",\n  \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\",\n  \"is_valid\": true,\n  \"is_completed\": true,\n  \"ip_address\": \"11.111.11.111\",\n  \"is_mobile\": false,\n  \"user_session_id\": \"bbbbbb-bbbbbb-bbbbbb-bbbbbb-bbbbbb\",\n  \"business_name\": \"Your Business Name\",\n  \"business_id\": \"your_business_id\",\n  \"campaign_name\": \"Sample Survey\",\n  \"campaign_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"channel_name\": \"full_page\",\n  \"sub_channel_name\": \"full_page\",\n  \"sub_channel_label\": \"Full Page\",\n  \"sub_channel_type\": \"time\",\n  \"L\": \"Full Page\",\n  \"uid\": \"sample-user-id\",\n  \"deferred\": \"true\",\n  \"email\": \" [email protected] \",\n  \"form_field_dropdown_values\": {\n  },\n  \"$metadata\": {\n    \"attribute_types\": {\n      \"email\": \"input\"\n    }\n  }\n} Connect Lytics Identity with Jebbit The last step in the process is to dynamically update the iFrame url to include the visitors Lytics _uid. There are several ways to do this, depending on the tools and resources at your disposal. Below you'll find one example and a description of what is happening. Please review this code in its entirety with your development partners to ensure there is no chance of an unintended conflict with your source code. 🚧 The following snippet requires the Lytics JavaScript tag to be present on your site before it can be called. Failing to ensure that load order will result in a JS error due to jstag being undefined. Out of the box, the Lytics JavaScript SDK provides an asynchronous \"getid\" function . This is used to retrieve the visitor's current _uid . To leverage this function, the core Lytics SDK must already be present. Otherwise, a JavaScript error will occur. In the example below, we leverage this function to find the current \"src\" definition for the Jebbit iFrame. An assumption is made that only 1 Jebbit iFrame is present on the page and that it leverages a class of \"jebbit-iFrame.\" If this is false, the querySelector on line 4 must be altered to match your implementation. We then leverage a simple query add or update function to determine if the src already contains a uid. If it does, we'll update and if not we'll append a new query param to the src, which includes the uid, as per Jebbit's preferred method and documentation. Example javascript jstag.getid(function(id){\n  // helper function to either add or update a the uid query param\n  function addOrUpdateQueryParam(n,r,s){var t=n,i=\"\",e=\"\",u=t.indexOf(\"#\");-1!==u&&(e=t.substring(u),t=t.substring(0,u));var a=t.indexOf(\"?\");-1!==a&&(i=t.substring(a+1),t=t.substring(0,a));for(var d=[],o=i.split(\"&\"),p=0;p<o.length;p++){var g=o[p].split(\"=\");g[0]!==r&&d.push(g[0]+\"=\"+g[1])}return d.push(r+\"=\"+encodeURIComponent(s)),\"\"!==(i=d.join(\"&\"))&&(i=\"?\"+i),t+=i+e}\n  var jebbitIframe = document.querySelector('.jebbit-iframe');\n  if (jebbitIframe) { \n    var existingSrc = jebbitIframe.getAttribute('src');\n    var updatedSrc = addOrUpdateQueryParam(existingSrc, \"uid\", id);\n    if (updatedSrc) {\n        jebbitIframe.src = updatedSrc;\n    } else {\n        // take an action the source of the jebbit iframe was invalid for any reason\n        // console.log('Invalid iFrame Source');\n    }\n  } else {\n      // take an action if no jebbit iframe was found\n      // console.log('No Jebbit iFrame Found');\n  }\n}) In most cases, the above example can be dropped into your preferred tag manager alongside the core Lytics JavaScript SDK. Testing Upon completing the above configuration a test can be performed for a published Jebbit Experience. Simply visit the test site where the Lytics tag and Jebbit iFrame are present. Complete the survey and verify data is being updated in the defined Lytics stream. In our testing, it can take several minutes for the form data to populate in Jebbit and be subsequently passed to the Lytics platform.

    "title": "Contentful",
    "content": "Contentful Suggest Edits Overview Contentful is a powerful and flexible headless content management system (CMS) that acts as a unified content layer to create amazing digital experiences at scale. Integrating Contentful and Lytics allows you to import content from your website, campaign, or custom structured content from Contentful to Lytics to personalize email, web, mobile, or ads content for your customers. This integration utilizes the Lytics Content Affinity Engine to classify Contentful documents and works with Lytics Content Recommendations to act as the decisioning layer for true one-to-one content personalization. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to setup a Contentful account before you begin the process described below. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Contentful from the list of providers. Select the Contentful Sign In method for authorization. When prompted, log in to the Contentful account you wish to authorize and follow the steps per Contentful's instructions. Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. Click Save Authorization . You can now use your authorization when setting up webhooks to import content. You will need the ID of the authorization created, which you can copy from the authorization list: Configure Webhooks Configuring webhooks in Contentful will allow you to send content to Lytics when it's published. You can send custom topics through this integration in addition to the standard Lytics topic extraction process using natural language processing. Imported Contentful entries can be included as part of Content Collections and Recommendations to power marketing campaigns personalized with one-to-one content. Before You Begin Before you set up webhooks to go to Lytics make sure you've completed the following prerequisites: Have a Lytics API token with the Data Manager role ready. You can read how to generate a new API token if you do not already have one. Go through the authorization process and have your authorization ID ready. If you are not currently using webhooks in Contentful, it may help to read through the Contentful documentation on webhooks and webhook transformation to familiarize yourself with these concepts. Configuring the Webhook Follow these instructions to set up the webhook integration. Log into your Contentful account. In the space you wish to configure, click Settings and then Webhooks . Click Add Webhook . Add a name for your webhook such as \"Lytics Content Collection\" or something similar. Under URL , select the POST method and enter the following URL: https://api.lytics.io/collect/json/contentful_webhooks Under Triggers you can configure what events the webhook should fire on by selecting Select specific triggering events . For this integration it is recommended to select Entry events on Publish . Note : Currently this integration only supports content entry ingestion and updates. There is no way to remove, mark as unpublished, or archive entries from Contentful in Lytics, thus these event types are not recommended for use in the webhook. You can add additional filters such as Environment or Content Types. Note: If your content types differ vastly in the naming of common fields, you may need to create one webhook per content type as you will need to map individual Contentful fields to Lytics fields. Under Headers you will need to add two custom headers: Authorization - your generated Lytics API token. Lytics-Auth-ID - the ID you created during the authorization step . Select application/json under the Content Type drop down. Under Payload select Customize the webhook payload . You will need to construct a custom payload to map fields to names that Lytics will recognize and can ingest. Use the webhook transformation documentation and the section on payload fields below to construct your payload. Once you're ready to begin sending webhooks to Lytics, click Save to activate the webhook. The next time a qualifying event (such as publishing an entry) takes place in Contentful, you should be able to see that document in Lytics. Payload Fields When constructing the custom payload of your webhook, you will want to include the following fields: Payload Field Name Supported Contentful Field Types Description space_id space.sys.id metadata field Contentful space ID. environment_id environment.sys.id metadata field Contentful environment ID. id sys.id metadata field Entry ID. type contentType.sys.id metadata field Content Type ID of the entry. created createdAt metadata field Date the entry was created. updated updatedAt metadata field Date the entry was last updated. version revision metadata field Number of the current entry version. title Short Text Title of the entry. description Short Text Long Text (Plain) A short summary of the content usually no more than a couple sentences. body Short Text Long Text (Plain, Markdown) Rich Text Main body of content. published Date & Time publishedAt metadata field Date the entry was last published. author Short Text Name of the author of the entry. image Media (One file, Image) Primary image to represent the content. topics Short Text (List) Custom topics to assign this entry in the Lytics topic taxonomy. Sample Payload Use the following sample payload as a reference when constructing your own. Be sure to rename your Contentful fields and locales as necessary and omit any fields that don't apply to your content types. JSON {\n    \"space_id\": \"{ /payload/sys/space/sys/id }\",\n    \"environment_id\": \"{ /payload/sys/environment/sys/id }\",\n    \"id\": \"{ /payload/sys/id }\",\n    \"type\": \"{ /payload/sys/contentType/sys/id }\",\n    \"created\": \"{ /payload/sys/createdAt }\",\n    \"updated\": \"{ /payload/sys/updatedAt }\",\n    \"version\": \"{ /payload/sys/revision }\",\n    \"title\": \"{ /payload/fields/title/en-US }\",\n    \"description\": \"{ /payload/fields/description/en-US }\",\n    \"body\": \"{ /payload/fields/body/en-US }\",\n    \"published\": \"{ /payload/fields/publishDate/en-US }\",\n    \"author\": \"{ /payload/fields/author/en-US }\",\n    \"image\": \"{ /payload/fields/image/en-US }\",\n    \"topics\": \"{ /payload/fields/lyticsTopicTags/en-US }\"\n} 📘 For content fields that have locales you want to send to Lytics, you should include the locale in the field mapping (the above example uses the en-US locale). The current integration cannot accept multiple locales per field unless you map them separately. Be sure to test your webhook . If you've mapped anything incorrectly, individual fields may not appear in Lytics as expected. Testing and Validation After you've configured the webhook you should test it to ensure data is being received in Lytics properly. There are some steps you can take in both tools to troubleshoot the webhook. Contentful First you will need to trigger the webhook by taking an action in Contentful. Navigate to an entry in Contentful which is qualified to trigger the webhook. Perform an action on this entry which will trigger the webhook (such as making a change to the content and publishing the entry). Navigate to Settings > Webhooks and click View details next to your Lytics webhook. In the Activity Log tab you should see a log of webhook requests. If the webhook was received successfully HTTP 200 should be present in the Call result column. Click View details to view the full request and response payload. Ensure that all the expected fields are included and formatted properly. Lytics If your webhook request looks as expected, you can validate the content has synced and is mapped correctly in Lytics: To ensure data has been received by Lytics, navigate to Data > Data Streams and select the contentful_content stream from the drop down. If this stream is not present, Lytics has not received content from Contentful yet. If raw data is present, you can check that it is being processed by building a Content Collections of all your Contentful entries. Navigate to Content > Collections . Select New Collection . You will use the soucre field to build this collection - which contains the ID of the content from Contentful, since it is a non-standard field. You can select the Advanced Editor from the ... menu in the Collection editor. Under Custom Rule find and select the source field. Select the equals rule and then type contentful into the text box to include all documents received from contentful in the collection. Then click Add Condition . Under Sample Documents on the right side of the editor, you should see a list of Contentful documents that have been imported via the webhook. You can click on one to see the detailed view of the document. 📘 If no sample documents appear this may be because your data is processing. It may take longer to process the first time you receive content from Contentful. If the document does not appear, but you are able to see data in the data stream, contact Lytics support to ensure the content queries for your account are up to date. Validate that all the fields you expect to see are present and formatted correctly in the document summary. 📘 Documents with a rich text body field will have an additional field, \"HTML Body from Contentful Rich Text\" which contains the rich text body parsed ad HTML, while the \"body\" field itself includes plain text. Back in the advanced collection editor, you may opt to name and save your collection, or use any of the imported fields to further refine your collection for use in Content Recommendations If you run into issues during any of these steps, feel free to reach out to the Lytics support team for assistance.

    "content": "Fields & Mappings Suggest Edits Introduction User fields and mappings are essential for materializing user profiles in such a way that provides businesses with a comprehensive view of their customers. User fields capture specific attributes and characteristics, while mappings transform and cleanse data for consistency and accuracy. This ensures your profiles are materialized in an ideal way to support highly relevant and personalized marketing campaigns. What are fields? Fields can include demographic data, behavioral data, or any other data point that is relevant to understanding and engaging with customers. In addition, fields themselves are defined by one of many common data types, such as strings, integers, sets, and maps. What are mappings? Sometimes, you may want to transform or cleanse messy data before it hits a profile.  Other times, you may want to perform an operation or aggregation to reflect its usefulness for business decisions or segmentation — like aggregating multiple purchases into a combined lifetime spend metric. In either case, mappings provide the necessary translation layer to ensure each data point collected is clean and consistent. Most importantly, mappings guide the relationship between disparate data points and the final materialized user profile. Managing User Fields Lytics' profiles are composed of a collection of user fields.  These fields have standard metadata (name, description) and typical properties you'd expect from a traditional database column (kind/type, capacity).  In addition, each field has a merge operator that describes how we want to combine data from different sources at different times into a single field.  For example, a field describing a customer's first purchase date would use a minimum operator to ensure that, regardless of the order in which Lytics sees purchase data, the first purchase date for the field would represent the earliest possible value. Creating a User Field To create a user field, visit Fields under the Schema tab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current field definitions. Clicking on + Create New will enter the field creation wizard. The field creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new user field. ID : An alphanumeric key that defines how this user field will be stored on the profile. Short Description : A user-friendly description that will be used throughout the ID to provide additional context to the field. Data Type : The type of data that will be stored in this field. Long Description : An optional long description that provides additional context in a few areas throughout the UI. Categories : An optional categorization for the field in question. This helps further inform the intent of the field and enhances our ability to measure the comprehensiveness of your user profile and overall C360 readiness index (coming soon). Identity: A field to identify a user within Lytics or in a downstream channel tool. Governance: Any context related to consent, governance, etc. Interests: Information supporting surfacing and understanding a consumer's interests, such as a product purchase. Behavior: Interactions to be used in understanding behavioral patterns such as page views and non-conversion-related clicks. First Party: Any standard first-party data. Intelligence: ML/AI-related attributes such as LTV ingested from BigQuery or scores related to Lytics models. Activation: Data points related to supporting or monitoring activation in downstream channels. Merge Operator : How the merge between two different data points mapped to the same field will be handled. Identity Key : A true or false statement identifying if the field should be used as a key to link two or more independent events together. Keep Days : The number of days to keep values for this field. Capacity : The number of values to store in the set. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Key : A true or false statement identifying if the field is to be considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Data Types Standard: Data Type Description string Stores a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation) with no set limitation for length. integer Stores positive or negative whole numbers without decimals. 64-bit. number Stores positive or negative numbers with decimals. 64 bit. boolean Stores only true or false values. date Stores datetime. Advanced: Data Type Description []string Stores an array of unique string values []time Stores an array of unique datetime values date[]string Stores a time-ordered unique array of strings (useful for keeping track of order in which they performed set of unique events) map[string]datatype Stores a set of key-value pairs. The key is a unique string and the value is a the specified data type. The value by default will be the most recent value. map[string]string map[string]integer map[string]number map[string]boolean map[string]date map[string]intsum Stores a set of key-value pairs. The key is a unique string and the value is an integer, but, unlike a map[string]integer, the default merge operator is sum, so the values are summed together. Merge Operators Supported merge operators are as follows: Minimum : When comparing two values, take the smallest one. Maximum : When comparing two values, take the largest one. Oldest : When comparing two values, take the one with the oldest timestamp. Latest : When comparing two values, take the one with the most recent timestamp. Merge : When comparing two sets, take the union of the two. Capacity and Keep Days The keep_days and capacity properties specify the amount of time to keep values, and the number of values to retain in a set field, respectively. Any values in the set older than keep_days in the past will be discarded when the profile is evaluated, and no more than capacity values will be stored in the set. When values are removed from a set due to exceeding the capacity limit, they are removed in FIFO (first in, first out) order. If keep_days or capacity are set to 0 or omitted when creating a field, they are ignored. Maintaining a User Field As your schema grows in complexity, keeping an eye on the defined relationships is essential. The field summary provides a window into how a single user field is being populated from various channels. This view is excellent for diagnosing what may be causing a conflict or that things are operating healthily. Deleting User Fields Sometimes you may want to remove a user field from your schema altogether. This can be done from the field summary pictured above. Click the menu with three docs to the right of Edit Field and you will be presented with a sub-menu. This menu contains a Delete option. 🚧 Deleting a field can have major implications once the change has been published. It is important to understand the implications of deleting a field and how it will impact how data is processed and mapped to user profiles. What happens when I delete a field? As shown in the screenshot above, selecting and confirming deletion will not have an immediate impact. The delete will request will be referenced in the unpublished version of your schema. You must publish a new version of your schema for the changes to take effect. At that point, it is essential to understand the following: Data previously collected and mapped to that field will no longer be accessible on the user profile. Any existing mappings related to that field will no longer be implemented as new events occur. Any mappings that are associated with this field will need to be independently deleted. Failing to delete associated mappings manually will result in validation errors when attempting to publish the schema version. Managing Mappings Mappings are expressions that provide instructions for how to perform transformations (if any) on raw data.  They can range from simple to expressive or even include conditional logic. Mappings occur when data is processed or observed within Lytics' real-time profile pipeline.  Multiple mappings can map data into a single field, where the field's merge operator controls updates. Let's say we have a user currently visiting the lytics.com website, and we observe the following data sent from JSTag: JSON {\n  \"email_address\": \" [email protected] \",\n  \"_uid\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",\n  \"utm_campaign\": \"exciting_campaign\",\n  \"url\": \"www.lytics.com/get-started\",\n  \"event_type\": \"page-view\"\n} Based on the data from the event, we might consider some of the following mappings: email_address : no transformation performed, and takes the value of the email as-is. email(email_address) : use the email function to validate that the email address is syntactically valid. email(oneof(email_address, emailAddress)) : coalesce either email_address or emailAddress to extract the value of the email address. count(event_type) IF event_type == \"page-view\" : sets up a counter to track page views, only if the event is of type \"page-view\". Creating a Mapping To create a mapping visit Mappings under the Schema tab in the main navigation at the left of your window. Here you will find a list of all current mapping definitions. Clicking on + Create New will enter the mapping creation wizard. The mapping creation wizard has a single step where you will define a few parameters related to your new mapping. Stream : The name of the stream for which to apply the mapping to. Expression : The rules to apply to the mapping. Condition : An optional condition statement of when to apply the mapping. Maintaining Mappings Since mappings depend on the data available to a stream, monitoring that things are working as desired is important. For instance, if a key changes or stops streaming entirely, it may negatively impact your profiles and, ultimately, your marketing efforts. As such, the mapping summary view is available to review the health of mappings and provide a path for editing mappings in the future if necessary. Deleting Mappings Sometimes you may want to remove a mapping from your schema altogether. This can be done from the mapping summary pictured above. Simply click the menu with three docs to the right of Edit Mapping and you will be presented with a sub-menu. This menu contains a Delete option. 🚧 Deleting a mapping can have major implications once the change has been published. It is important to understand the implications of deleting a mapping and how it will impact how data is processed and mapped to user profiles. What happens when I delete a mapping? As shown in the screenshot above, selecting and confirming deletion will not have an immediate impact. The delete will request will be referenced in the unpublished version of your schema. You must publish a new version of your schema for the changes to take effect. At that point, it is crucial to understand the following: Data previously collected via the mapping being deleted will remain on the profile as mapping changes only impact event processing from when the change has been published. Fields associated with the mapping will not be impacted or deleted. Updated 4 months ago Table of Contents Introduction What are fields? What are mappings?

    "content": "Experiences Suggest Edits 📘 Lytics Experiences have replaced the legacy Personalize functionality, as such Personalize campaigns are no longer supported by Lytics. If your account has not yet migrated from Personalize to Experiences, you may access our legacy documentation here . Experiences Quick Start Overview Experiences allow you to present tailored messaging to specific audiences. These messages can be on your website using Lytics Experiences, appear on a third-party ad platform like Facebook, or emails delivered through an email service provider like SendGrid. Since you can control the audience being targeted, you can deliver Experiences that make sense for some users but not others. You can even recommend products or content based on each user's unique content affinities and behaviors. Experiences allow you to treat your customers as individuals rather than over-messaging them with generic offers and newsletters. Common uses of Experiences include: Present an email capture form to anonymous users but not to users who have already shared theirs. Let only eligible users know about a targeted sale or promotion. Keep your audience engaged by serving content recommendations tailored to their browsing behavior. Limit Facebook ads to users who are likely to engage with them, saving your advertising budget. You can create and import new Experiences as well as browse existing Experiences (including those that are associated with a Goal) by navigating to the Experiences tab Add your first Experience The set up for each Experience is slightly different, so whether you are creating an on-site Lytics Experiences or connecting to one of our out-of-the-box Integrations, the simplest way to get started with experiences is to create a new Experience and allow our Experience Editor to navigate you through each of the steps. Managing Experiences Experience List View Within the Experiences tab in the Lytics app, you will find a list of all of your Experiences. From this view you can Add Experiences Browse Experiences View the Status of your Experiences Navigate to Experience summary pages to work with individual Experiences See below for more information around each of these activities. Adding Experiences Creating New Experiences Create a new Experience within the Experiences tab by clicking the Add Experiences button near the top of the page. Selecting the New option will guide you through the Experience Editor steps for any Experience ( Lytics , Out-of-the-Box Integrations , or Generic ) 📘 The New option allows you to select from the full list of providers. Importing Experiences If you want to import external marketing initiatives from out-of-the-box integrations that support Experiences , you can do so within the Experiences tab as well. Click the Add Experiences button near the top of the page and select the Import option to be guided through the Experience Editor steps for these supported integrations. 📘 The Import option navigates you to directly to a list of the out-of-the-box integration providers. Browsing Experiences Search: The easiest way to find an Experience is to use the Search box to the right of the Experience list. As you enter your search term, the Experiences list will display any matching Experiences. Filter: To the right of the Experience list you can filter Experiences based on their... Channel: The channel is associated with the Provider you selected when creating the experience Integration: The Provider you selected when creating the Experience Status: Life-cycle and health of the Experience Type: Whether or not the Experience is associated with a Goal 📘 Imported Experiences that haven't been activated yet will be tagged as Externally Managed Sort: By default, the list of Experiences is sorted by Name . If you choose to sort by date Last modified instead, your preferences will be saved for the next time you visit. Experience Statuses An Experience status indicates what life-cycle the Experience is in and the health of whether it is exporting a Lytics audience to a third-party tool in real-time. Below is a complete list of Experience statuses: Draft: A complete, or partially complete Experience that has not yet been activated. Active: An Experience that can be seen by your users (and has not passes its end date). Paused: An Experience that was activated but has been paused. To edit an Experience that has been running, you must pause it first. Scheduled: An Experience that will be activated at a start date set in the future. Externally Managed: An imported Experience from a third party tool that hasn't been configured with a Lytics audience. Complete the configuration by editing the Experience in the Experience editor. Ended: An Active Experience that has passed its end date. Error: An Experience that failed to export audience data to the appropriate tool. Warning: An Experience that encountered issues when attempting to export audience data to a third party tool. It may recover on its own, or proceed to an error status after a number of failed attempts to export data. Experience Summary View Once you have created or imported Experiences they will be populated as a list within the Experiences tab. Click on an Experiences from the list to enter the Experiences summary. From this summary page you can... See an overview of the Experience Activate, pause or resume Experiences Edit an existing Experience Delete an existing Experience See below for more information about each of these activities. Experience Overview Within the Experience summary you will find important information about your Experience. The summary includes: Experience Status Experience Performance Reporting Experience Intelligence Report (for accounts with the Lytics View feature enabled) Sample Audience Members (a small sample of users in the target audience that are eligible for the experience) Activity (recent activity around changes made to the Experience) Details (an overview of the configuration of the Experience) Activating Experiences From the Experience summary page you are able manage the activation of individual Experiences using the following buttons on the righthand side of the summary page. Activate : An Experience has not been previously activated, and is currently marked with the Draft status, can be activated. Pause : Campaigns currently marked as Active can be paused Resume : Any previously activated Experiences that are currently paused can be resumed Editing Experiences Within the Experiences section of the Lytics app, you can edit an existing Experience by clicking on the desired Experience. This will navigate you to the Experience summary page. Here you can click on the Edit button to enter the Experience Editor for this Experience. 📘 You cannot edit an Experience while it is activated, so you will not be able to enter the Experience editor at that point. If you need to edit an Active Experience, you can Pause it from the Experience summary page. Once you have made and saved your edits, you can then Resume the experience from the Experience summary page Deleting Experiences To delete an experience from Lytics, click on the Experience you wish to delete from within the Experiences list. You will be navigated to the Experience summary page where you can delete the experience from the options menu. You will be asked to confirm that you wish to delete the experience, click the Delete permanently button to complete the deletion. Experience Editor The Experience editor is used to create, save, edit, and activate marketing Experiences. Combined with audiences created in the audience builder , sophisticated Experiences can be built to deliver the right message to your users at the right time. To enter the Experience editor, you can either add an experience or edit an experience . The available steps of the Experience editor are dictated by the Experience provider you select. Experience Providers Lytics : Lytics Experiences allow you to create personalized campaigns on your website to capture leads, recommend content, drive traffic, etc without having to connect Lytics to an additional tool. The Lytics Javascript tag must be installed on your website for you to take advantage of this feature. Out-of-the-Box Integrations : Experiences added to Lytics from these providers allow you to monitor performance and activate audiences from the Lytics UI; however, the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. Facebook Google Ads Iterable Mailchimp Mapp Salesforce Marketing Cloud SendGrid The Trade Desk Generic : These experiences simply offer the ability to include a placeholder Universal Experience within the Goals Canvas and export a Lytics audience, with all of the nested Goal Stage filter logic, to any tool you choose. Lytics Experiences Use Lytics Experiences to personalize a website with modals, slide outs, sticky bars, etc. This does not require connecting to another tool. Experience Editor Steps for Lytics Experiences Select a Provider and Tactic Select a Provider and Tactic If you are creating or importing a new Experience, you will be given a choice of Experience providers - providers are the tools that deliver your Experience. The selection of Lytics as a provider will prompt you to select a tactic from a list of options. The following tactics are available for Lytics Experiences: Drive Traffic - Increase traffic to a specific URL. Capture Leads - Convert unknown users to known users with a simple lead capture form. Present a Message - Communicate a simple message, such as a global coupon or an announcement. Recommend Content - Use content collections to recommend articles, products, or any other type of content to your users. Once you've chosen your tactic, the Experience editor will take you though each step. Choose URL (unique to the Lytics Drive Traffic tactic) Choose URL Choosing a URL to promote is the first step in the Experience editor for a Drive Traffic Experience of the Lytics provider . This step does not apply to Experiences of any other tactic or Provider. This step allows you to enter the destination you want to link as a call to action in your Drive Traffic Experience. The protocol is preset to <https:// > but can be changed to <http:// >. Enter the rest of the URL into the input field. Customize Form (unique to the Lytics Capture Leads tactic) Customize Form Specific to the Collect Leads tactic of Lytics Experiences, this step is for selecting what information you collect on the form. Here you will configure which form fields will be shown and thus what information you capture about your user. Enable fields by selecting the checkbox next to the desired field. Form labels have default text input that appears when the field is selected. You can rename these labels to suit your use case. Require fields with the Required? checkbox at the right of the text field. Choose Content (unique to the Lytics Recommend Content tactic) Choose Content The Recommend Content Experience type is used to surface content (an article, a blog post, a product page) to visitors. Each recommendation is personalized to the individual. This could be used to keep visitors engaged by surfacing what to read next, or assist casual perusers by prompting a starting point. Furthermore, the Experience can be configured to only a set of pages or a subset of your total audience. This allows you to limit the recommendations from showing up on auxiliary pages like the home page, company page, or checkout page. It can also only be shown to users with high usage. This way low usage visitors can be targeted with a more aggressive campaign. Choosing content is the first step for a Recommend Content Experience. Lytics provides a variety of filters and options for tailoring what content can be recommended and how the recommendation algorithm should rank the content. Choosing a content collection A content collection allows you to limit the scope of documents that can be recommended by your Experience. If you're creating a summer seasonal experience, for example, you wouldn't want articles that are out of season. A content collection is how you define which articles are appropriate to recommend. Use the Select a content collection dropdown to choose an existing collection or to create a new one. Clicking on New content collection will take you to the collection builder . The state of your Experience will be saved, and after creating your new collection, you will automatically be returned to the Experience editor. Choosing recommendation settings The Lytics content recommendation engine allows you to configure the way in which the Experience will recommend content. 📘 The recommendation settings work within the limits set by the content collection. If your content collection includes articles published six to twelve months ago and you choose the Recently Published method, then the Experience will begin recommending six-month-old articles, which are the most recently-published articles within the collection. Recommendation method The recommendation methods control how the recommendation engine ranks the content. Highest Affinity: Choose the content that a user is most likely to be interested in. This is the default setting. Freshness: Choose the content that was most recently published or updated. Last Interaction: Choose the content based on what a user has engaged with most recently. New content only The Only recommend content the user has not seen? checkbox controls whether previously viewed content will be included among the recommendations. Leave this setting checked to ensure that a user won't be recommended content they have viewed in the past. Shuffle content The Shuffle content on each page load? checkbox controls whether a user should be recommended different content if they encounter the Experience again (e.g. after reloading). Check this setting to vary the content that is recommended on subsequent requests or leave it unchecked to show the single best recommendation. Design Design The design step is present in the editor for all Experiences of the Lytics provider . It lets you customize the appearance and content of the widget displayed to your users on your website. This step offers layout and position options as well as a custom CSS option. Choosing a layout First, choose your Experience's layout. There are five different layout options, and their availability depends on the tactic you selected. Modal : A full screen takeover Experience that can be closed by clicking outside the modal, clicking the close button of the modal, or taking the intended call-to-action. Slideout : A small widget that occupies a corner of the screen. It does not interrupt the user's current task. Bar : A short widget that takes the full width of the screen and sits at the top of the page. Sticky Bar : A bar that scrolls with the page. Gate : A modal that cannot be closed unless the call to action is fulfilled. Campaign type layout compatibility Layout Drive Traffic Collect Leads Present a Message Recommend Content Modal ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Slideout ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Bar ✔ ✔ Sticky Bar ✔ ✔ Gate ✔ Adding content Different content fields are supported by different Experience layouts or tactics. Layout Modal Slideout Bar Sticky Bar Gate Headline ✔ ✔ ✔ Message ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Tactic Drive Traffic Capture Leads Present a Message Recommend Content Call to action ✔ ✔ Image URL ✔ ✔ ✔ Including an image for your Experience is optional, the image will be shown above or beside the messaging of the Experience. Any image you include must be hosted publicly as this input takes a URL but not an upload. Setting position Experience widgets can be displayed in different positions depending on their layout. The available positions will show up as a darker gray while the active position is blue. Layout Modal Slideout Bar Sticky Bar Gate Top-left Top-center ✔ ✔ Top-right Center-left Center-center ✔ ✔ Center-right Bottom-left ✔ Bottom-center ✔ Bottom-right ✔ Theming the Experience There are three ways to theme your Experience. Choose a theme : Lytics provides Light and Dark themes you can select. Build a custom theme : There are eight color options available to build a theme in the Experience editor: Background : The color of the background color of the Experience. Headline : The text color of the headline message. Body Text : The text color of the body text. Close Button : The color of the '×' shape used as a close button. Submit Button Text : The color of the text in the submit/call-to-action button. Submit Button : The background color of the submit/call-to-action button. Cancel Button Text : The color of the text in the cancel/dismiss button. Cancel Button : The background color of the cancel/dismiss button. Use Custom CSS : Use your own custom CSS to match the Experience's styling with your site's design. Experiences are built using the Pathfora SDK. Read about using custom CSS with Pathfora . Target Target The audience step in the Experience editor allows you to configure the target audience for your Experience. Use the dropdown to select from among your pre-built audiences. Click New audience at the bottom of the dropdown menu if you need to build a new one and you will be directed to the audience builder . Standalone Experiences This step is required for standalone Experiences, such as a one-off email campaign or a seasonal ad promotion. Once you have selected an audience, Potential Reach displays how many people will be eligible to receive this Experience. Experiences part of a Goal This step is optional if your Experience is part of a Goal on the Lytics Canvas . Here you can add additional filtering to your Experience. Any audience you choose will be combined with the Stage audience, resulting in a more targeted Experience with a smaller audience. You can also leave this blank if you don't want additional targeting. The Potential reach displays how many people will be eligible to receive this Experience. The Stage coverage metric displays what percentage of the stage will be eligible to receive this Experience. Adjusting your Target If your Experience is not providing the desired results, you can pause your Experience and target a new audience. Just keep in mind that the metrics are for the Experience and won't explicitly indicate changes you made. You can also make changes directly to the target audience, and the potential reach of the Experience will be adjusted automatically. Finding the Right Fit for Your Content When creating a new Recommend Content Experience, you will see a content alignment score in the Target Audience step of the Experience Editor. Lytics calculates the alignment percentage by comparing the affinities of your target audience to the affinities in your selected content collection. Use the alignment score information to ensure you are recommending content or products that are relevant for your customers, which can help improve engagement and conversion rates of your marketing campaigns. For a quick demonstration of using the affinity alignment score while building a content recommendation, watch this video . Display Display The display step is present in the editor for all Experiences of the Lytics provider . Use the Display Step to set where and when the Experience will show up for your users. Set rules for which URL(s) an Experience can be displayed on, the triggers for displaying it, the frequency with which it appears, and the date range during which the Experience is available to show. 🚧 Prior to activating your Experience, ensure that the display URL is included in your URL Allowlist for Orchestrate account setting. Appears on Appears on rules are an optional tool used to specify which webpages within your site the Experience will (or will not) be shown on. This can be a fixed list of pages or expressions that match many pages. There are four URL-matching strategies offered, and rules can be used in combination. URL Contains – The text specified must be included in the URL. Simple Match – A fuzzy match that removes the URL protocol and query string before matching. Exact Match – The URL must match what is typed exactly, including protocol and query parameters. Regular Expression – A regular expression (sometimes referred to as Regex) to be executed client-side with JavaScript for complex matching requirements. Each of these URL-matching strategies can be used to create a rule determining when the Experience is shown with Show on selected, or to specify the cases where the Experience should not be displayed with Hide on . Appears on use cases Consider the following use cases, and some suggested solutions using the appears on rules. Only show the Experience on the home page Only show the Experience on the home page Solution: Show on a Simple Match for www.lytics.com . Displays for: <https://www.lytics.com > <http://www.lytics.com > <http://www.lytics.com?ad_campaign=1ed387faed > Does not display for: <http://www.lytics.com/blog > <https://activate.getlytics.com > Show the Experience on the blog, but nowhere else Show the Experience on the blog, but nowhere else Solution : Show on URL Contains /blog/ Displays for: <http://www.lytics.com/blog/ > <http://www.lytics.com/blog/some-post-in-the-past > <https://www.lytics.com/blog/tag/customer-data-platform?referrer=thegreatgoogle > Does not display for: <https://www.lytics.com/ > <http://www.lytics.com/careers > Gate a specific resource Gate a specific resource Solution : Show on an Exact Match for <https://www.lytics.com/resources?id=a763efd12c > Displays for: <https://www.lytics.com/resources?id=a763efd12c > Does not display for: <http://www.lytics.com/resources?id=a763efd12c > <https://www.lytics.com/resources?id=a763efd12c&something=that-will-404 > Show a referral thank you message on integration pages Show a referral thank you message on integration pages Solution : Show on a match for the Regular Expression \\/integrations\\/.+?\\?.*?ref=our_partner Displays for: <http://www.lytics.com/integrations/campaignmonitor?ref=our_partner > <http://www.lytics.com/integrations/campaignmonitor?session=125929&ref=our_partner > <http://www.lytics.com/integrations/adroll/?ref=our_partner > <https://www.lytics.com/integrations/segment?ref=our_partner&qp=true > Does not display for: <http://www.lytics.com/integrations/campaignmonitor?ref=some_stranger > <http://www.lytics.com/integrations?ref=our_partner > <http://www.lytics.com/blog/adroll?session=125929&ref=our_partner > Show the Experience anywhere on the site except the careers pages Show the Experience anywhere on the site except the careers pages Solution : Use two rules in combination. Show on URL Contains lytics.com Hide on URL Contains /careers Displays for: <http://www.lytics.com/blog/ > <https://www.lytics.com > Does not display for: <http://www.lytics.com/careers > <http://www.lytics.com/careers/content-writer > Advanced Display Options The Advanced Display Options allow you to respond to the user's interaction with your site, using the state of their active web session to determine when an Experience is displayed. These are all optional and can be used in combination. Display triggers Show after x page views – Do not show the Experience until the requisite number of pages have been visited. Show after x seconds – Do not show the Experience until the requisite number of seconds in the session have elapsed. Show after x% page scroll – Do not show the Experience until the user has scrolled a certain percent of the way down the page. Show on exit intent – Do not show the Experience until the user is about to abandon the site. When using triggers in combination, note that the conditions function as an ALL conditions met, not ANY condition met. If you set an Experience to Show after 5 page views and to Show after 70% page scroll , when your user scrolls to 70% of the third page, the Experience will not show because only one of the two conditions have been met. Display frequency Show up to x times per user, ever – After the specified number of times displaying the Experience, suppress its display forever for the current user. Show up to x times per user per session – After the specified number of times displaying the Experience, suppress its display for the current user. This count resets when the user ends their current session. If you set an Experience to Show up to 5 times per user, ever and Show up to 2 times per user per session , and a user is shown the Experience twice each on their first two sessions, for their third session they will be shown the Experience for the final time. If you set an Experience's frequency to Show up to 2 times per user per session and a trigger of Show after 5 page views , your user will see the Experience upon reaching the sixth page, again on reaching the seventh page, and not again during their session. When user clicks CTA Hide after x clicks – Hide the Experience after the user has clicked the call-to-action the specified number of times. Hide for x time – How long an Experience should remain hidden, in seconds/hours/days/weeks. Hide permanently – Instead of hiding an Experience for a set amount of time, never show it again for the current user. When user clicks cancel or close These are the same options as above, but applied to when the user has seen the Experience but not clicked the CTA. Pathfora Overrides Pathfora is a very powerful client-side personalization SDK. In addition, it is open-sourced. Because anyone is invited to contribute to Pathfora, providing clear controls for all features is impossible. As a result, we provide a technical but friendly interface for using \"overrides.\" Overrides allow you to leverage the full power of pathfora for functionality such as custom load and callback handlers and advanced customization and styling. In the coming weeks, we'll extend our documentation to outline several common patterns for leveraging overrides. For those looking for initial information, don't hesitate to contact your primary account contacts. For others that are already leveraging overrides directly via our APIs, you will also see a representation and area for managing those overrides directly within the \"Advanced Settings\" in the Experience wizard, as pictured below. Date Range Set the date range for when the Experience will be shown to your users. The start date will be populated with the current day, so that your Experience will start immediately without you needing to set anything. You can set a start date in the future and Activate the Experience ahead of time; it will have a \"scheduled\" status and then switch automatically to \"active\" on the start date. The end date is not required. If you do not set an end date, the Experience will run indefinitely as long as it is active. End dates cannot be in the past, nor can they precede the start date. The date range is inclusive, so if you set a start date of 3/21/2022 and an end date of 3/23/2022, the experience will run for 3 days. On 3/24/2022, the Experience will switch from \"active\" status to \"ended\" on its own and users will no longer see it. Review Review The review step is the final step for all Experiences of the Lytics provider . It provides an at-a-glance view of everything you've chosen for your Lytics Experience. Though there is nothing you need to do on this step, it does give you an opportunity to check that all your selections are listed as you expect before you activate the Experience. Previewing Use the Preview button in the top right of the screen to see how your experience will look when it's active on your site. Simply enter the URL you want to see the preview on in the modal that appears, and you'll be directed to your site but with the experience running as it will once it becomes activated. From this preview state you can get a better idea of how/when the experience is triggered and see what your users will see. 📘 The URL you enter must match the appears on conditions you set in the display step. The target audience, however, is ignored for previewing ease. Save and Exit Save and Exit When you first enter the Experience editor, you will see a Save button in the top right corner which allows you to save your progress at any time. If you have made it to the final step within the Experience Editor (Review for Lytics Experiences), the Next Step button will now be a Save and Exit button. Click on this button to save and exit your Experience. If you have previously saved your Experience and made no other changes this will simply allow you to exit the Experience Editor. 📘 After the Experience has been saved once, the button will become a Save button that is only enabled when you make further changes. Name your Experience If you have not yet named the Experience at the time you save, you will be prompted to do so at this time, and the Experience's tactic will be suggested as a default. 📘 When creating a new Experience within Lytics, name it including the purpose and any categorization (e.g. Drive sales: Holiday). When working with existing Experiences from your third party tools, name the imported experiences on Lytics with the same/similar names as in the external tool. Discard Changes Unsaved Experiences At any point you may discard your unsaved Experience by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor and then clicking Confirm when asked \"Are you sure you want to discard unsaved changes?\" You may also select the Delete option from the more options (...) menu in the top right corner of the Experience Editor and click Delete permanently when prompted. Both methods will remove you from the Experience Editor without saving. Previously Saved Experiences If you have previously saved the Experience and have returned to make edits, you may discard all changes you've made since your last save by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor (and clicking Confirm when prompted) or by selecting the Discard Changes option from the more options menu (...) in the top right column. The former will discard changes and exit the Experience Editor. The latter method will allow you discard changes, but stay within the Experience Editor where you can make new edits. Permanently Delete You may permanently delete previously saved experiences from within the Experience Editor by selecting the Delete option from the more options menu (...) in the top right column and clicking Delete permanently when prompted. Activating your new Lytics Experience 🚧 Prior to activating your Experience, ensure that the display URL is included in your URL Allowlist for Orchestrate account setting. Once you have completed the steps in the Experience Editor and saved your Experience you can Activate it from the Experience summary page . You will be directed to this page once you exit the Experience Editor. Out-of-the-Box Integration Experiences You can import existing marketing initiatives currently managed by your channel providers, which enables you to quickly gain insights about the campaigns you’re already running. You can then take action by connecting these Experiences to your Lytics audiences. To import an experience, click the Add Experience button in the Manage Experience page. You can select either the New or Import options in order to import experiences from our out-of-the-box integrations. Both options will direct you to the same flow. 🚧 You can monitor out-of-the-box Integration experiences and activate audiences for them within Lytics, but the management of external Experiences still happens inside your channel tools. Pausing or deleting imported Experiences in Lytics simply stops the audience syncing process. It does not pause or delete the campaign in your channel tool. Experience Editor Steps for Out-of-the-Box Integration Experiences Select a Provider and Tactic Select a Provider and Tactic From the provided list, you will choose a provider from the list of out-of-the-box integrations. Each provider has a single tactic selection associated to it. You will need then need to configure the experience based on that selected provider. Below you will find an overview of the steps for navigating the Experience Editor for out-of-the-box integrations. For more detailed information for specific integrations, use the links below to navigate to the the integration documentation for your selected provider: Facebook (Tactic: Import Ad Set) Google Ads (Tactic: Import Ad Group) Iterable (Tactic: Import Campaign) Mailchimp (Tactic: Import Campaign or Automation) Mapp (Tactic: Import Campaign) Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Tactic: Import Journey) SendGrid (Tactic: Import Campaign) The Trade Desk (Tactic: Import Ad Group) Choose Authorization Choose Authorization After selecting your provider, you will be prompted to select or create an authorization to connect the integration. Existing authorizations will be shown. If you have multiple accounts within a particular channel, you will choose which account to import from. If you don’t have an authorization, you will be prompted to add one before continuing. To create a new authorization, click the Add new authorization button, which will take you to a modal where you can enter the appropriate credentials. For provider-specific documentation on creating authorizations, see the below documentation for your selected integration. Facebook Google Ads Iterable Mailchimp Mapp Salesforce Marketing Cloud SendGrid The Trade Desk Import Import After you have selected your Authorization you will then select the campaigns you want to import into Lytics (you may select up to 10 at a time). The total number of Experiences you can bring into Lytics is only limited by the amount in your connected provider. However, to have meaningful and accurate reporting, it's recommended to only import Experiences that will add value to the use cases you are activating within Lytics. Completed campaigns that have already \"ended\", will not show on the list of importable Experiences. Those that are saved as drafts, paused, or currently running, those will be available to import. Target Target Once you have imported an Experience, you will activate it by adding a Lytics audience. This lets you enrich your existing campaigns with Lytics behavioral audiences , content affinities , and Delivery Optimization . The Target step in the Experience editor allows you to configure the target audience for your Experience. Use the dropdown to select from among your pre-built audiences. Click New audience at the bottom of the dropdown menu if you need to build a new one and you will be directed to the audience builder . Configure Integration Configure Integration The Configure step in the Experience Editor allows you to configure how the audience for your Experience will be exported to the third-party tool you are using. In order to successfully activate and export an Experience to your provider tool, you will need to correctly configure the Experience. See below for links to the configuration documentation for each supported integration. Facebook Google Ads Iterable Mailchimp Mapp Salesforce Marketing Cloud SendGrid The Trade Desk Configure Delivery Configure Delivery Delivery Optimization takes the guesswork out of deciding who to send what message, and when. For the third party Experience providers built-in to the Lytics Canvas, you can use this option to automatically determine when to deliver messages to individual users on those channels. This step in the Experience editor allows you to toggle Delivery Optimization On or Off . If you do nothing, it will remain off. You can turn it on to help prevent over-messaging and let you focus on creating great Experiences, rather than manually building delivery logic rules that are complicated to manage and execute. How does Delivery Optimization work? Lytics uses data science to determine the optimal delivery time of an Experience for individual audience members. The delivery time is based on when an audience member last interacted with your brand via the channel of the Experience, as well as their behavior when that interaction happened. Experience decisioning also uses the Experience's performance measured by click-through rate (CTR) to estimate engagement likelihood. 📘 The actual delivery of an Experience is always controlled by the downstream tool, where there could be additional logic necessary to deliver the Experience. Lytics Delivery Optimization simply controls when the user data is triggered to send to your third-party tool. Consider the Experience tactic when determining if you want to turn Delivery Optimization on. For Experiences using real-time delivery such as Iterable triggered emails , Delivery Optimization can help improve user engagement by reaching each user at the ideal time. In other circumstances such as sending a one-time blast email through SendGrid for a sale promotion, you'll likely want to leave Delivery Optimization off and simply push a list of all current users into the audience so that you can send the campaign as soon as you're ready. If Delivery Optimization was enabled, you may not see users exported to SendGrid until they \"need\" to receive a message (the most optimal time). Save and Exit Save and Exit When you first enter the Experience editor, you will see a Save button in the top right corner which allows you to save your progress at any time. If you have made it to the final step within the Experience Editor (Configure Delivery for out-of-the-box integrations), the Next Step button will now be a Save and Exit button. Click on this button to save and exit your Experience. If you have previously saved your Experience and made no other changes this will simply allow you to exit the Experience Editor. 📘 After the Experience has been saved once, the button will become a Save button that is only enabled when you make further changes. Name your Experience If you have not yet named the Experience at the time you save, you will be prompted to do so at this time, and the Experience's tactic will be suggested as a default. 📘 When creating a new Experience within Lytics, name it including the purpose and any categorization (e.g. Drive sales: Holiday). When working with existing Experiences from your third party tools, name the imported experiences on Lytics with the same/similar names as in the external tool. Discard Changes Unsaved Experiences At any point you may discard your unsaved Experience by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor and then clicking Confirm when asked \"Are you sure you want to discard unsaved changes?\" You may also select the Delete option from the more options (...) menu in the top right corner of the Experience Editor and click Delete permanently when prompted. Both methods will remove you from the Experience Editor without saving. Previously Saved Experiences If you have previously saved the Experience and have returned to make edits, you may discard all changes you've made since your last save by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor (and clicking Confirm when prompted) or by selecting the Discard Changes option from the more options menu (...) in the top right column. The former will discard changes and exit the Experience Editor. The latter method will allow you discard changes, but stay within the Experience Editor where you can make new edits. Permanently Delete You may permanently delete previously saved experiences from within the Experience Editor by selecting the Delete option from the more options menu (...) in the top right column and clicking Delete permanently when prompted. Activating your new Out-of-the-Box Integration Experience Once you have completed the steps in the Experience Editor and saved your Experience you can Activate it from the Experience summary page . You will be directed to this page once you exit the Experience Editor. UTM Tracking In addition to tracking default UTM variables when users visit your website, Lytics supports two custom UTM parameters specific to tracking clicks from out-of-the-box Integration Experiences. When to use custom UTM parameters You may be recommended by the Lytics Experience Insights to add UTM parameters to an Experience. The Lytics insights system will check the target URL of your eligible imported Experiences to see if it has these parameters configured and advise you on which Experiences are missing them. For most email providers click information is collected automatically through webhooks or APIs, but for ads this is the only way of recording user attribution. Lytics highly recommends using these UTM parameters in your ad Experiences as it will not only allow you to build and target audiences of users who have converted on your ad in Lytics, but it will also inform Lytics decisioning and insights as the platform builds a better understanding of which users respond to which Experiences. Custom UTM parameters Use the following custom UTM parameters in any links coming from your external Experiences. Name Value utm_lytics_experience The ID of the object from the third party tool (e.g. ID of the ad set for a Facebook Experience) utm_lytics_source Slug of the provider (e.g. facebook for a Facebook ad set) These variables allow us to link the website visit with a click from the Experience. Thus recording what users clicked on what Experience. ❗️ Using these UTMs will only work if the website linked from your ad has the Lytics JavaScript Tag installed. Adding the parameters The steps for adding these parameters may differ by provider, but generally speaking you can add them directly to the target URL of your Experience, for example: https://www.lytics.com?utm_lytics_source=facebook&utm_lytics_experience=23847 Please refer to the providers that have specific docs on how to add these parameters: Facebook User field The UTM parameter is recognized by Lytics and mapped to the user field Converted on Experience (URL Param) which is available in the audience builder so that you can create audiences of users who have clicked on your Experiences. The key of this map field will contain the External ID of your Experience and the value will be the number of times the user clicked on the ad set. If you find that the number of users in an audience utilizing this field does not match the conversion count you are seeing on your Experience summary page, it is important to remember the source of these numbers is different . Usually for ad providers, metrics are aggregate numbers imported directly from the API of the ad tool. If you added the tracking URL parameter to your ad after publishing, you may see a smaller user count when utilizing the user field. Generic Experiences Generic Experiences allow you to export your Lytics audience to any tool you choose. Since you will not be able to monitor the performance of this Experience from Lytics, it's primary use cases are to act as a placeholder for.. An Experience of an integration that is not built into the Lytics Goal Canvas An Experience of a custom implementation using webhooks or inline web personalization . Generic Experiences allow you to produce audiences with all the nested targeting rules of a Stage within a Goal to make the audience mutually exclusive of the other Stages. As such, Generic Experiences should only be used for Experiences included in a Stage of a Goal. 📘 Unlike out-of-the-box integration Experiences, Delivery Optimization and Experience reporting is not available for Generic Experiences, so Generic Experiences should only be used for Experiences included in a Stage of a Goal. Experience Editor Steps for Generic Experiences Select a Provider and Tactic Select a Provider and Tactic From the provided list, you will choose a Generic as the provider. Generic Experiences only support one tactic: Universal Experience - Create a general Experience to be used with any use case or integration supported by the Lytics platform. Target Target The Target step in the Experience editor allows you to configure the target audience for your Experience. Use the dropdown to select from among your pre-built audiences. Click New audience at the bottom of the dropdown menu if you need to build a new one and you will be directed to the audience builder . Tutorial Tutorial This step offers a quick overview of the additional steps you will need to take to activate your Audience for this Experience Save and Name Name, Save and Exit Upon saving and naming you Experience, an audience will be generated. If you are still within the Experience Editor the Tutorial screen will be updated to provide a link to the generated audience. If you have exited the Experience Editor you can find this link by clicking the Help link in the Experience summary page. Save your Experience When you first enter the Experience editor, you will see a Save button in the top right corner which allows you to save your progress at any time. If you have made it to the final step within the Experience Editor (Tutorial for Generic Experiences), the Next Step button will now be a Save and Exit button. Click on this button to save and exit your Experience. If you have previously saved your Experience and made no other changes this will simply allow you to exit the Experience Editor. 📘 After the Experience has been saved once, the button will become a Save button that is only enabled when you make further changes. Name your Experience If you have not yet named the Experience at the time you save, you will be prompted to do so at this time, and the Experience's tactic will be suggested as a default. 📘 When creating a new Experience within Lytics, name it including the purpose and any categorization (e.g. Drive sales: Holiday). When working with existing Experiences from your third party tools, name the imported experiences on Lytics with the same/similar names as in the external tool. Discard Changes Unsaved Experiences At any point you may discard your unsaved Experience by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor and then clicking Confirm when asked \"Are you sure you want to discard unsaved changes?\" You may also select the Delete option from the more options (...) menu in the top right corner of the Experience Editor and click Delete permanently when prompted. Both methods will remove you from the Experience Editor without saving. Previously Saved Experiences If you have previously saved the Experience and have returned to make edits, you may discard all changes you've made since your last save by clicking on the Close button (X) in the top left corner of the Experience Editor (and clicking Confirm when prompted) or by selecting the Discard Changes option from the more options menu (...) in the top right column.

Permanently Delete You may permanently delete previously saved experiences from within the Experience Editor by selecting the Delete option from the more options menu (...) in the top right column and clicking Delete permanently when prompted. Activating your new Generic Experience Once you have completed the steps in the Experience Editor and saved your Experience you will need to navigate to the created audience and export it to the integration of your choice. Navigate to the created audience in the Experience summary page by clicking on Help and then the link found within the Finish setting up your Generic Experience section. Export the audience from the Audience summary page. Experience Reporting Experience Performance Reporting On the Experience summary page, you will find Experience performance reporting. This reporting contains three metrics for the campaigns you’ve created or imported into Lytics. Use these metrics to establish a baseline of your campaign performance and measure growth over time. Name Description Updated Reached Number of unique users who have been reached by the Experience: unique impressions for ads, or unique opens for emails. Every 2 hours Clicks Number of unique users who have clicked the Experience. Every 2 hours Click Rate Percentage equal to (number of unique users who have clicked on the Experience / number of unique users who have been reached by Experience. Every 2 hours Experience Intelligence Report In addition to the Experience Performance Reporting, the Lytics View feature can be enabled in your account to give you additional information about your Experiences via an Experience Intelligence Report. The Experience Intelligence Report, once enabled, will add the following modules to your Experience summary page (as well as in the Goal Intelligence Report for Experiences within Goals): Experience Insights Goal Attribution (for Experiences used within Goals) Content Recommendations Data Science Performance Simulation 📘 Your account must have Lytics View feature enabled in order to see this module. Reach out to your Customer Success Manager to have this feature enabled. Experience Insights The Insights module displays how many Insights have been generated for your account in the last week. Lytics Experience Insights are the combination of a fact and an action. The fact is a metric about your audience or campaign data, and the action is a recommendation on how to improve engagement and conversions. Leverage Insights while evaluating and planning your campaigns to make data-driven iterations and achieve your goals more efficiently. Name Description Updated Insights Insights combine a metric and a recommended action to improve customer engagement. Weekly See Insights Introduction to learn more. Goal Attribution The Goal Attribution module displays metrics around how conversions on your Experience relate to conversions on your Goal. The percentage compares the total number of people reached by the Experience and those who converted. For Facebook Ads with UTM parameters included, Lytics will capture conversion data at the user level. Use this metric to determine which campaigns to invest more or less in based on how they contribute toward your larger marketing Goal. Name Description Updated Attribution Rate Percentage equal to (attributed conversions for an Experience / number of users that engaged with the Experience). Weekly Attribution Graph Number of users who have converted on both your Experience and your Goal in the past week. Weekly Content Recommendation The Content Recommendation module surfaces content that is likely to resonate with your users based on their past behavior. Lytics analyzes and classifies the content on your website through the Lytics JavaScript Tag.

    "content": "Behavioral Scores Learn about Lytics' Behavioral Scores Suggest Edits Overview Lytics uses data to create more data through a suite of data science techniques. The purpose is to synthesize raw, impenetrable data into something insightful that can be utilized effectively in campaigns. This synthesis, like all data in Lytics, is applied at the user level. While aggregated analysis may be helpful for looking at trends in customer behavior, user-level analysis can be utilized for one-to-one marketing. Much like how the Lytics Content Affinity Engine allows for immediate targeting and execution using content affinity audiences, Lytics descriptive and predictive modeling allows for immediate targeting and execution using behavioral analysis. Behavioral Analysis Lytics constantly tracks events from many data sources: web, email, Salesforce, and custom sources as well. Looking at this data directly is not useful; it needs to be summarized. Lytics allows for simple summaries by means of user fields and for use in audiences, but there is more to be learned from all this behavioral data. Behavioral analysis asks many questions and computes the answer. Questions such as: When did the user last visit? When did they visit before that? Is it unusual that they visited right now? During their visit, what were they up to? Did they visit a lot of pages? Did they stick around for a long time? How does that compare to other users? Are they going to come back? Is this a good time to encourage more interaction? After finding the answers to these questions, for every user, Lytics uses these answers to inform nine low-level scores that get assigned to every user who has shown enough behavior for a confident assessment. These scores are computed automatically, they are kept up to date continuously, and they are assigned relative to other users in the account. Behavioral Scores There is a lot to learn looking at user-level behavioral data. Lytics evaluates behavioral data automatically in real-time and reports nine scores for each user. These scores each represent a distinct behavioral quality and can be composed to build rich audiences. Please note, users must have behavioral data to make confident measurements before they have scores. If a user was added to Lytics via email upload, for instance, they would have no scores. Score Description Quantity Measures a user's cumulative activity over their lifetime of brand engagement. Frequency Measures how often a user is interacting with your brand over time. Recency Measures how recently the user's general interaction has been. Intensity Measures the depth of a user's typical interaction with your brand. Momentum Measures the rate at which users are interacting with your brand. Propensity Predicts how likely a user is to return with subsequent activity. Consistency Measures the regularity of a user's engagement pattern. Maturity Measures how long a user has registered interactions with your brand. Volatility Measures how sporadic a user's behavior is while interacting with your brand. Note: If you are already a customer of Lytics, you can see the following explanation of each score alongside your own data in the app on the Scoring page. Quantity Quantity measures a user's cumulative activity over their lifetime of brand engagement. The more activity the user registers, the higher the score. This score measures the user relative to all other users. It is a common tactic to target a user based on the number of times the user has visited a website or has performed some other behavior. This becomes increasingly difficult as marketers add more data sources to their stack, and the user continues to engage over time. Quantity takes into account a user's behavior on all data sources and measures that relative to how the most and least active users are engaging — so a user's score will always be between 0 and 100. You can think of this as a test score. What is the point of scoring between 0 and 100? This is how we can ensure that any audience created with a score will always stay relevant. Perhaps 1,000 page visits seems like a lot for a user now, but the number will only grow larger as your site grows older and the amount of content you have increases. Another benefit of having a bounded score range is the ability to see the complete distribution of all users. This is an example of how scores look like across an entire audience. The x-axis is the score (ranging from 0 to 100; 5 to 95 in the example for clarity) and the y-axis is the number of people who have that value as their score. Frequency Frequency measures how consistent a user is interacting with your brand over time. More frequent interactions means a higher score. This score measures the user relative to all other users. This serves as a measurement of user regularity. Do they visit once a week? Once a day? Once a lifetime? Since this score is relative to all your users, you can easily target your most frequent users, rather than something like \"users who visited in the last week\", which will vary wildly in size. Again, this score has a fixed range of 0 to 100. All the scores are like this. It is how we can continuously update user profiles without having to update audience definitions. Recency Recency measures how recently the user's general interaction has been. More recent activity means a higher score. This score measures the user's recent activity relative to the user's past activity. Without scoring, this would be achieved by looking at the last time a user visited. Although better than nothing, that approach is kind of crude. Maybe an at-risk user opened your email by accident? It'd be an expensive oversight to assume that the user had recent activity and didn't need any nurturing. Intensity Intensity measures the depth of a user's typical interaction with your brand. More sustained intense/deep usage means a higher score. This score measures the user relative to all other users. The behavior a user exhibits during a single session is very telling of them as a consumer. If they have high interaction in a session (high intensity) they are more likely to be a deeper researcher or more curious. If they have low interaction in a session (low intensity) they are more likely to be casually browsing or engaged with a certain piece of content, but not your overall brand. Momentum Momentum measures the rate at which users are interacting with your brand. Users who are interacting more than usual with your brand will have a higher score. This score measures the user's recent activity relative to the user's past activity. It's easy to confuse how momentum and recency differ, but they are actually very different. Universally speaking, we've found them to have a 5% correlation. Recency measures absolute recency of activity, but just because a user has recent activity, doesn't mean they're not at risk of churning. If a user maintains a constant rate of activity, their momentum score will be 50. If they are more active than they used to be, their momentum will be greater than 50 and might warrant a loyalty offer. If they are less active than they used to be, their momentum will be less than 50 and might warrant a win-back campaign. Propensity Propensity predicts how likely a user is to return with subsequent activity. Users exhibiting positive interaction patterns are more likely to return and have higher scores. This score measures the user relative to all other users. There are many reasons why users churn — changing interests, competition from competitors, bad experience, etc. — but from a data perspective, attrition of any kind starts to look similar. Propensity employs an ensemble of statistical models to identify any patterns it can find for detecting how and when attrition starts to occur. With time, it's able to find more patterns in your data and become increasingly accurate in identifying when users start to exhibit those behaviors. Consistency Consistency measures the regularity or stability of a user's engagement pattern. Users who engage with your brand at a regular cadence will have higher scores. For example, a user that registers behavior every 7 days will have high consistency, and would have the same consistency as a user who registers behavior every 30 days. As users' behavior starts to vary — sometimes every 7 days, sometimes every 30 — the users' consistency score will decrease. Consistency scores can be paired with propensity scores to build more accurate Lookalike Models to predict customer churn and target users with win-back programs before they bounce. Learn more about how to reduce churn using Lytics Lookalike Models. Maturity Maturity is a normalized measure of how long a user has registered behavior. This indicates how \"old\" a customer is relative to your other users. A user who has registered behavior over 5 years will likely have high maturity. A user who registered behavior over 3 years, but hasn't registered any in 2 years will have less maturity. A user who registered behavior over the most recent 3 years will have the same maturity as the user previously mentioned. As an example, you could target users with high maturity scores inviting them into a loyalty rewards program via ads, emails, and in-app notifications. You may also want to consider suppressing engaged users who are likely to make their next purchase without additional advertising. Low maturity users, on the other hand, could be served more onboarding or educational content to nurture them into high-value, long-term users. Volatility Volatility measures how stable vs. sporadic a user is interacting with your brand. It represents the stability of the volume of data that a user is generating, and serves as a slightly more nuanced version of the intensity score. Consider a user where 100% of their daily sessions are considered \"intense\". Their intensity score would be 100, but the score doesn't yield any information regarding the volatility of a typical session. Utilizing Scores Each Lytics score is accessible as a Custom Rule in the Audience Builder. They can be added to any audience definition as an intelligent filter when the size of the audience is larger than desired. For example, when crafting an audience to be used to buy ads against, the size of the audience is critical. The size can be arbitrarily shrunk by taking 10% of the matching users, or it can be intelligently shrunk by creating a threshold with a Lytics score such as Propensity or Momentum. This way, the best fit users remain. Interfacing with scores directly can be difficult. They are low-level building blocks that require expertise to use to their fullest. To make these scores more readily usable, Lytics offers out-of-the-box Behavioral Audiences that use scoring under-the-hood. Customizing Data Sources Lytics scores work best on behavioral data — that is, data that was generated by a user, like a web view or email open, rather than on list imports or other non-behavioral data. Every supported 3rd party integration is already configured to include only behavioral data in user scores. By default, any custom integration is assumed to be non-behavioral. If you're using a custom integration that you want to contribute to behavioral scores, contact your account manager to update the setting. Behavioral Audiences Since using Lytics behavioral scores directly requires a level of understanding of the data science at play, Lytics also offers out-of-the-box behavioral audiences. These audiences are essentially blends of scores that can be used alone or as a rule in a custom audience. For example, Casual Visitors describes users who come and go without showing much activity per session. The definition using Lytics scores is Users with an intensity score less than 25 . Now, instead of needing to know exactly what \"intensity\" means in this context, or what the significance of the number 25 is, the audience Casual Visitors can be used as a building block. In this example audience, the Casual Visitors characteristic is being used to filter the users who have a high affinity for \"Computing\". Note that the number of people who have a high affinity for \"Computing\" is 276,046, but the number of people who have a high affinity for \"Computing\" and qualify as a Casual Visitor is 185,747. Reducing the size of an audience is a great way to make a campaign more efficient. Additionally, splitting an audience based on behavioral properties is a great way to introduce different modes of communication for different archetypes of users. For instance, Casual Visitors may not stick around long enough to answer their own questions, try engaging them with a slideout on early page visits. The opposite of Casual Visitors, Deeply Engaged Visitors, are probably determined to find that information on their own and would find a popup to be annoying. Splitting the audience keeps both archetypes engaged without accidentally detering anyone. The Full Set of Out-of-the-box Behavioral Audiences Frequent Users: Users who interact with your brand a lot. Definition: Frequency Score > 65 . Infrequent Users: Users who interact with your brand occasionally. Definition: Frequency Score < 35 . Deeply Engaged Users: Users who show a lot of activity when they do interact with your brand. Definition: Intensity Score > 75 . Moderately Frequent Users: Users who occasionally interact with your brand. Definition: score frequency > 34 and score_frequency < 76 . Casual Visitors: Users who show little activity when they do interact with your brand. Definition: Intensity Score < 25 . Likely To Re-engage: Users likely to come back based on their past activity patterns. Definition: Propensity Score > 75 . Unlikely To Re-engage: Users not likely to come back based on their past activity patterns. Definition: Propensity Score < 35 . At Risk Users: Users whose interaction behavior is changing for the worse. Definition: Momentum Score >= 10 and Momentum Score <= 30 . Binge Users: Users who show a lot of activity when they do interact with your brand. Definition: Frequency Score <= 20 and Intensity Score >= 50 . Perusers: Users who visit often but rarely interact deeply with your brand. Definition: Frequency Score >= 70 and Intensity Score <= 20 . Lytics Behavioral Audiences The follow out-of-the-box audiences are prefixed with \"Lytics\" and can be found in the Audiences list. Lytics New : Users who were created within the past 7 days. Definition: _ created > \"now-7d\" . Lytics Disengaged : Users who show minimal or no activity for a prolonged period of time. Definition: Frequency <= 5 and Intensity = 0 and Momentum = 0 and Quantity <= 3 and _created < \"now-7d\" . Lytics Previously Engaged : Users who are currently disengaged with your brand, but had been previously. Definition: Momentum <= 10 and NOT Lytics Disengaged and NOT Lytics New Lytics Highly Engaged : Users who engage most frequently and consistently of your users. Definition: Quantity >= 50 and Frequency >= 50 and Intensity >= 25 and Momentum >= 40 and NOT Lytics New and NOT Lytics Previously Engaged . Lytics Currently Engaged : Users who are currently engaging with your brand. Definition: Momentum > 10 and NOT Lytics Highly Engaged and NOT Lytics Disengaged . Taking it further Remember that each of these out-of-the-box behavioral audiences can be recreated with the audience builder using Lytics scores user fields. Mastering Lytics scores will open up the possibility of new combinations of score thresholds that result in new behavioral audiences to be used as building blocks in campaigns.

    "content": "Google Cloud Operations (Formerly Stackdriver) Suggest Edits Overview Google Stackdriver is a monitoring service that collects logs, metrics, and traces across your applications and Google Cloud. Integrating Lytics with Google Stackdriver allows you to export a variety of Lytics metrics to Google Stackdriver monitoring services so that you can easily set up dashboards, alerts, and thresholds inside your existing monitoring tool. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up a Google Cloud Project before you begin the process described below. You will need \"Editor\" rights to your project to be able to ingest Lytics custome metrics. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Google Cloud from the list of providers. Select the Stackdriver Metrics Service Account JWT method for authorization. Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. In JSON Service Account JSON , enter your Google Service Account JSON Key . The instructions for collecting this JSON token are detailed beflow. Click Save Authorization . Stackdriver Metrics Service Account JSON Key During the configuration process for authorizations of type JSON key you will need to create a service account . In Google Cloud console under IAM & Admin select Service Accounts . Click + Create Service Account Enter the details for your new service account and click Create . From the Role dropdown menu, search for and select Monitoring Editor and click Continue to grant these account permissions. Optionally grant users access to this service account. You will be directed back to the main Service Accounts page and you should now see your newly created service account. Select this service account, click Keys tab, click Add Key , and select Create new key from the dropdown menu. Select JSON for key type and click Create to download your new key as a JSON file. The entire contents of this file represent your Google Service Account JSON key and will be used to authorize Google Stackdriver in Lytics. Export Metrics Export Lytics custom metrics to an existing Google Cloud project. These metrics include a monitoring heartbeat, an API heartbeat, collection count, and stream count. These metrics allow you to monitor, alert, and visualize important metrics from Lytics. Instead of building alerting into Lytics, Google Stackdriver Export Metrics allows metrics to be written into your own monitoring tool. These metrics can be used to: Allow alerting, oncall distribution lists, quiet-hours to be managed within a tool where you are already doing that for other metrics. Allow correlation of metrics you have (possibly website performance, etc) to be shown in context of other metrics. Prevent operational users from having to create a Lytics admin user-account. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration Frequency : Metrics are written every 60 seconds. Resulting Data : Lytics custom metrics (monitoring heartbeat, API heartbeat, collection count, and stream count) This integration utilizes the Google Cloud Monitoring Custom Metrics API to create and send Lytics custom metrics to your Google Stackdriver dashboards. Monitoring Heartbeat is a heartbeat of health of our metrics reporter API Heartbeat is a heartbeat of health of Lytics API Collection Count is a delta count of all events Stream Count is a delta count of all events per stream per hour. Stream Count is reported hourly. Configuration Follow these steps to set up an export job for Google Stackdriver. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Destinations documentation for more information. Select Google Cloud from the list of providers. Select the Export Monitoring Metrics job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. Enter the Google Project you want to write metrics to. Click Start Export . Note: After the job has started, you will be able to find Lytics custom metrics in Google Cloud Monitoring. This may take up to 10 minutes. Once Monitoring Heartbeat metric is reported, then Lytics custom metrics are being received. Using the Metrics Once you have the metrics imported, you can now set up dashboards and alerting .

If the steps for Including Lytics Audience Information below are followed, fields will be added corresponding to the audiences the user is a member of. If Audiences to Include is populated, only those configured audiences will be added. Otherwise, all of the user's audiences will be added. After all users are sent, the job will sleep for 24 hours and then repeat the process. Fields By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Zendesk: Export Users: Lytics User Field Description Zendesk Field Type full_name Full Name Full Name string first_name First Name First Name string last_name Last Name Last Name string Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Zendesk in the Lytics platform.

For example, you built a “test” user to validate a campaign is working correctly, you want to see how your marketing efforts are influencing individual user's behavior, or you need to view/delete a profile for GDPR compliance. Follow these steps to search for a user profile in Lytics: In the app, select Audiences from the navigation menu Select Find a user from the expanded menu Select the field you would like to search with from the drop-down menu. By default, Email is selected. In the Search box, enter the email address (or selected search term) of interest.

    "content": "Engage Qualified Users with Targeted Ads Suggest Edits Using Lytics audiences you can identify anonymous traffic with higher potential to engage and/or convert. A powerful marketing use case is to retarget these users with Facebook and Google Ads, driving them to further interact with your brand. Leveraging user data This use case will provide a few suggested audience definitions to support your retargeting effort. These audiences will leverage the following building blocks: Lytics preconfigured audiences such as characteristics and behavioral audiences . Commerce user fields such as Lifetime Value (LTV) or Lead Status . Lytics data science scores such as frequency , recency , and intensity . Note: The Lytics StartSmart data schema supports a standard set of commerce fields including the two used in this use case. If you aren't using the StartSmart schema these fields may also be mapped to your account, for example if you've imported data from Salesforce you should have access to the field Salesforce: Most Recent Lead Status . Building your target audiences Using the building blocks mentioned above you can build one or more of these suggested audience to use in ad campaigns. Anonymous Deeply Engaged This audience combines the characteristic Email Capture Status: Unknown email with the behavioral audience Lytics Deeply Engaged using the “AND” rule. The deeply engaged characteristic uses the intensity score, and is a great way to qualify anonymous traffic for targeting. Known High LTV Combine the Email Capture Status: Known email with the User's Lifetime Value field using the \"AND\" rule to create a target audience of just your best customers. This audience would be a great source audience to generate a lookalike audience. Known Leads For B2B marketing you can substitute LTV with a field like Lead Status to build an audience of open leads for retargeting or for use in a lookalike audience. Refining your audiences with user fields Want to further narrow your audience to only the most qualified users? Try experimenting with additional rules using the frequency score to bring in more consistent users, or the recency score to target users who recently interacted with your brand. These qualifiers can help you create a further refined audience of users who are more likely to convert. Activating your audience Once you've built your audience(s) you can export them to your ads platform for use using Lytics' build in integrations. Retargeting anonymous users Anonymous users can be advertised to directly in Facebook. You can access the Anonymous Deeply Engaged you built in Facebook with the Create Web Traffic Audiences workflow . You can also target anonymous users in Google platforms such as Adwords through our JavaScript integration with Google Analytics. Reach new, qualified users with Lookalike audiences Known users can be targeted across both Facebook and Google, as well as drive lookalike audiences. You can export your Known High LTV and Known Leads audiences via Facebook custom audiences and Google Adwords remarketing lists . To power lookalike audiences which will find users similar to your best customers, read more on creating a lookalike audience in Facebook , or using Google Customer Match .

Identify Key Topics The Lytics content affinity engine builds a topic taxonomy from content on your website. Lytics will use this taxonomy and user activity data to determine a user's affinity for a topic. These content affinity scores are available in the audience builder, and will be core to building your target audience. Select the piece of content you wish to promote. Then take some time to familiarize yourself with the topics in your Lytics account and try to identify the Lytics topics that are relevant to your content. You can sort by the average level of affinity on the topic list view to ensure you are using a popular topic for targeting criteria. You may choose one or more of these topics to include in an Affinity , which you can then use to create audiences. Clicking on a topic displays a summary page which shows a full distribution of user interest. Build an Audience Using Content Affinity For most marketing use cases, it's useful to target users based on their interests in a group of related topics. For this reason, Lytics enables you to create your own, brand-specific Affinities. You can also target users based on their interest in an individual topic. See our Audience Builder documentation for more information. Once you have your Affinity rules included, verify that the user count of your audience looks correct. If you plan to use this as a source audience for a lookalike, Facebook expects anywhere from 1,000 to 50,000 users . For a simple retargeting audience, you'll want to reach a broad number of users. You may adjust the sliders on your affinity rules accordingly. Using your Lytics Audience in an Ad Campaign To use your Lytics content affinity audience in Facebook lookalike ads campaign, Follow through with the steps below: Export to Facebook Create a Facebook Lookalike Audience Assign your Lookalike Audience to an Ad To run a retargeting ad to the users in this audience: Export to Facebook as a custom audience. Create your ad following your normal process. If you are building an ad for the first time, follow the Facebook Ad creation guidelines . Select the custom audience created by the export during the audience set up process of ad creation.

    "title": "Privacy and Data Protection",
    "content": "Privacy and Data Protection Suggest Edits Privacy and Data Protection As a service provider and data processor, Lytics assists its customers in enhancing security and meeting privacy and data protection obligations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). Listed below are the compliance-enabling functionalities Lytics provides. As used below, personally identifiable information (PII) has the same meaning in the CCPA and is meant to include “personal data” as defined in the GDPR. Please consult your company’s legal counsel or privacy professional about what privacy and data protection requirements your company must comply with. Lytics recognizes that its customers are the data controllers of the PII, which Lytics processes on their behalf. Each Lytics customer maintains control over which PII sources and destinations to use with Lytics and the types and content of PII shared between its sources and destinations. Lytics does not sell PII or supplement its customers’ respective PII with third-party data except via customer-directed integrations. Access Control Restrict access to personal information by role. Role Based Access Controls (RBAC): Account Admins can easily add and remove account users. Lytics has various defined user roles with respective permissions. Single Sign On (SSO): Add SSO to your user login process to enhance security. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Add MFA to your user login process to enhance security. Restrict access to PII : You can indicate any user fields that contain PII via the private fields account setting. These fields will be hidden for anyone who does not have Admin, Data Manager, or User Search roles. You should verify with Lytics Support that the field hiding in the segment scan is also enabled for your account to ensure these fields are also hidden there. Data Mapping Map personal information processed by Lytics, including sources and destinations. Audit your data schema : Use the Schema Audit feature to see what user fields are being populated, the data contained, the source(s), and if that data is being used in audience definitions. Determine third-party data sources : You can see the third-party data sources from which you send data to Lytics using the Lytics UI by navigating to Data > Data Streams . The \"default\" stream will contain your web data unless otherwise configured. You will see your other integrations in the list of stream names using the drop-down menu at the top right. Each stream page will show you the last time Lytics received data. Determine third-party data destinations : You can view the activity history for a data destination using the Lytics UI by navigating to Data > Integrations . Click on the tile for the integration in question. If you're already running the integration, you will automatically be taken to the overview page that shows a list of running imports and exports and the history of events for those works. Notice and Consent Manage user consent and preference data. Obtaining Customer Consent Lytics customers are responsible for obtaining consent for collecting and transferring PII to Lytics for processing. You can use the Lytics JavaScript Tag to collect PII about customers' online behavior. One consent mechanism is to implement a custom tag and trigger in your Google Tag Manager account and assign that trigger to the Lytics JS tag. See how to manage consent with Google Tag Manager. For sites not using Google Tag Manager, customer consent on the web can be managed in several ways. Consent triggers can be listened to by adding a snippet of custom JavaScript to your site. Another alternative is to use a cookie-consent solution, many of which exist. Github has documented a free solution , including demos. The Lytics JS Tag can be configured to consume triggers from any of these solutions to manage consent for your customers. Recording Proof of Consent : Schema fields may be established for the purpose of storing customer consent. Privacy Policy Notice : When you use a Lytics modal to collect user information, you should include a link to your organization’s privacy policy regarding the treatment of the PII collected. A link can be added to any modal created using the Experience Editor. Age Gating : If you have collected accurate age data, you can build audiences that target or exclude certain ages. Responding to Consumer Requests Respond to the data subject (consumer) requests in compliance with regional and state privacy and data protection requirements. Personal Data Access : Using the find a user feature, enter the identifying details provided by the consumer to locate their profile. The profile \"created\" date refers to the earliest date Lytics collected any data on this user. Personal Data Correction : If user profile data requires correction, you must send the corrected data to Lytics, which will be remapped to convert the resulting user profile information. Determining Categories of Personal Data Collected : You can use the Lytics UI to obtain information about the categories and specific pieces of PII collected on a consumer in the past 12 months. Again using the find a user feature, you can view the fields of populated data and determine the appropriate consumer PII categories to disclose to a requesting data subject/consumer. Personal Data Portability : We support the export of profile information via the Lytics UI or APIs. An individual’s profile data from Lytics will be downloaded as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. JSON is a common, machine-readable file format. Personal Data Deactivation/Suppression : You can establish audiences to enforce consumer suppression and “do not market” choices and prioritize those choices when establishing marketing journeys for your consumers. These audiences can be exported from Lytics to your downstream tools or \"data destinations.\" Personal Data Deletion : We provide a method for deleting users via the Lytics UI. Our API may also be used for this purpose. This will send a deletion request to the Lytics platform, which will process the request for the customer identifier provided. SOC 2 Audits An independent auditor has examined Lytics platform controls and confirmed they are in accordance with the Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type II Trust Services Principles for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality. You can learn more about our SOC 2 Type II examination in this blog post . Lytics will continue to engage independent auditors to conduct SOC 2 Type II audits regularly and make our audit report available to our customers and prospects under an NDA. In addition, we retain independent security firms to conduct regular penetration tests and vulnerability scans on our systems and code, respectively. Our underlying cloud services provider, Google, also submits to regular, multiple independent audits, including SOC 2 Type II audits. Safeguards and Transfers Lytics Data Protection Safeguards : Lytics and its data hosting partner, Google, have implemented numerous safeguards to protect the PII that Lytics processes on its customers' behalf. External auditors audit these safeguards on an annual basis. For more information regarding these safeguards, please ask your Lytics account manager. Transfers of Personal Data from EU : Lytics participates in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks regarding collecting, using, and retaining personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified with the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles . Please let your account manager know if your organization requires Lytics to enter into the EU Standard Contractual Clauses regarding data transfer from the EU to the U.S. Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents Privacy and Data Protection Access Control Data Mapping Notice and Consent Responding to Consumer Requests SOC 2 Audits Safeguards and Transfers",

If you have create a two variations of your widget, the conversions and reach will be tracked separately for each variation. Conversions are defined a little differently for each campaign type. Here are the definitions for each campaign type: Content Promotion: User clicks through to the promoted content. CTA: User clicks on the CTA. Lead Gen: User submits lead gen form. Present a message: No conversion.

    "content": "How to Use GTM Tags to Modify Lytics Pathfora Widget Behavior a Tutorial to modify pathfora behaviour using custom javascript tags in GTM Suggest Edits Introduction Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a powerful tool for managing tags, triggers, and scripts on your website. Lytics offers a variety of widgets through its Pathfora framework, allowing businesses to personalize and target content to their users. This article will show you how to use GTM to modify the behavior of Lytics Pathfora widgets by utilizing custom JavaScript and CSS. Prerequisites A working knowledge of Google Tag Manager Basic understanding of JavaScript and CSS Access to your website's GTM and Lytics accounts Step 1: Create a JavaScript Tag in GTM for Lytics Embedder Go to your Google Tag Manager Dashboard and click on \"New Tag.\" Name the tag \"Lytics Embedder.\" Choose the tag type as \"Custom HTML.\" Paste your Lytics Embedder JavaScript code into the HTML field. For example: JavaScript // Your Lytics Embedder code here Choose the triggering event for your tag. For instance, you can set it to trigger when a custom event \"embedder variable = true\" occurs. Save and publish the changes. Step 2: Create a CSS Tag in GTM for Lytics CSS Master Go back to the GTM Dashboard and create another new tag. Name the tag \"Lytics CSS Master.\" Choose the tag type as \"Custom HTML.\" Insert the CSS code wrapped in style tags into the HTML field. For example: HTML <style>\n// Your Lytics CSS Master code here\n</style> Set the trigger to \"All Pages Page View\" so the CSS will be applied universally. Save and publish the changes. Step 3: Testing and Validation Open your website and inspect the Lytics Pathfora widgets to make sure they are behaving and appearing as intended. Use browser developer tools to troubleshoot any issues, such as incorrect application of styles or non-functioning JavaScript. Step 4: Customization and Advanced Uses You can further customize the Lytics Embedder JavaScript to manipulate widgets based on user behavior or other events. Similarly, modify the Lytics CSS Default to change the look and feel of the widgets to better align with your brand. Conclusion Utilizing Google Tag Manager along with Lytics' Pathfora framework can greatly enhance your ability to deliver personalized and targeted content to your website visitors. By following these steps, you can modify widget behavior and appearance directly from GTM, making your marketing efforts more efficient and effective. Example code A javascript to dynamically alter pathfora behaviour: Use this code in gtm and associate to a custom variable <script>\n  // Get the \"h2\" and \"p\" elements with their respective class names\n  // var headlineElement = document.querySelector('.pf-widget-headline');\n  var messageElement = document.querySelector('.pf-widget-message');\n\n  // Get the \"img\" tag with class name \"pf-widget-img\"\n  var imgElement = document.querySelector('.pf-widget-img');\n\n  // Create a new \"a\" tag\n  var linkElement = document.createElement('a');\n  linkElement.href = messageElement.textContent;\n  linkElement.classList.add('pf-widget-custom-href');\n\n  // Append the \"img\" tag inside the new \"a\" tag\n  linkElement.appendChild(imgElement.cloneNode(true));\n\n  // Replace the \"img\" tag with the new \"a\" tag in the DOM\n  imgElement.parentNode.replaceChild(linkElement, imgElement);\n</script> Lytics CSS Default - a js to update css dynamically in pathfora: <style type=\"text/css\">\n/* lytics-small-modal start */\n  .lytics-small-modal .pf-widget-content{\n    display:none;\n  }\n  .lytics-small-modal .pf-widget-img {\n    width: 100% !important;\n    height: 100% !important;\n    float: none !important;\n    position: absolute !important;\n    top: 0 !important;\n    left: 0 !important;\n    margin-left: 0 !important;\n    border-radius: 0 !important;\n}\n  .lytics-small-modal {\n  cursor: pointer;\n  }\n  .lytics-small-modal .pf-widget-body {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n  .lytics-small-modal .pf-widget-close {\n    z-index: 1;\n}\n.lytics-small-modal{\n    width: 250px;\n    height: 250px;\n}\n/* lytics-small-modal end */  \n  /* lytics-capture-leads styles start */\n  .lytics-capture-leads .pf-widget, .lytics-capture-leads .pf-widget .pf-widget-body, .lytics-capture-leads .pf-widget-message, .lytics-capture-leads .pf-form-label, .lytics-capture-leads .pf-widget-checkbox{\n    color: rgb(46, 46, 46) !important;\n}\n  .lytics-capture-leads{\n  background-color: rgb(235, 177, 17) !important\n  }\n  .lytics-capture-leads .pf-widget-headline{\n  color: white;\n  }\n  /* lytics-capture-leads styles end */\n  \n    /* lytics-preheader-modal styles start */\n.lytics-preheader-modal{\n\tbackground-color: #ffb32a;\n\tmin-height: 0;\n\tpadding: 0;\n    box-shadow: none;\n}\n\n.lytics-preheader-modal .pf-widget-message{\n\tcolor: black;\n}\n\n.lytics-preheader-modal .pf-widget-close{\n\tcolor: black;\n}\n  \n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .lytics-preheader-modal {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n    /* lytics-preheader-modal styles start */\n  \n  /* lytics-personalization-coupon styles start */\n.lytics-personalization-coupon.pf-widget-modal.pf-widget-variant-2 .pf-widget-img {\n    float: none !important;\n    position: absolute !important!important;\n    top: 20px !important;\n    left: 5% !important;\n    margin: 0% !important;\n    width: 90% !important;\n    height: auto !important;\n    border-radius: 0px !important;\n}\n.lytics-personalization-coupon.pf-widget-modal.pf-widget-variant-2 .pf-widget-content {\n    background-color: #EEB111 !important;\n}\n  .lytics-personalization-coupon.pf-widget-modal .pf-widget-message {\n    font-size: 14px !important;\n    margin: 0 0 0px !important;\n}\n  .lytics-personalization-coupon.pf-widget, .pf-widget .pf-widget-body, .lytics-personalization-coupon.pf-widget-modal.pf-widget-variant-2 .pf-widget-headline{\n  color: black !important;\n  }\n  /* lytics-personalization-coupon styles end */\n /* lytics-personalization-coupon black-back styles start */\n  \n  .lytics-personalization-coupon.black-back.pf-widget-modal.pf-widget-variant-2 .pf-widget-content {\n    background-color: black !important;\n}\n  .lytics-personalization-coupon.black-back.pf-widget, .pf-widget .pf-widget-body, .lytics-personalization-coupon.black-back.pf-widget-modal.pf-widget-variant-2 .pf-widget-headline{\n  color: white !important;\n  }\n  /* lytics-personalization-coupon black-back styles end */\n  \n  \n   /* lytics-big-modal styles start */\n  .lytics-big-modal .pf-widget-img{\n    position: relative !important;\n    margin: 0 !important;\n    top: 0 !important;\n    left: 0 !important;\n    border-radius: 0 !important;\n    width: 100% !important;\n    height: 100% !important;\n    cursor: pointer !important;\n}\n  \n  .lytics-big-modal .pf-widget-text{\n    display: none !important;\n}\n  \n  .lytics-big-modal .pf-widget-content{\n    padding: 0px !important;\n}\n  .lytics-big-modal .pf-widget-close{\n    z-index: 1 !important;\n    color: black !important;\n}\n  /* lytics-big-modal styles end */\n</style> Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents Introduction Prerequisites Step 1: Create a JavaScript Tag in GTM for Lytics Embedder Step 2: Create a CSS Tag in GTM for Lytics CSS Master Step 3: Testing and Validation Step 4: Customization and Advanced Uses Conclusion Example code",

    "title": "Google Ad Manager (DFP)",
    "content": "Google Ad Manager (DFP) Suggest Edits Overview Google Ad Manager (also known as DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP), allows you to generate revenue on your website by displaying ads inline with your site's content. Using Lytics, you can pass the audiences an individual visitor is currently a member of to expand the level of targeting available for any Ad Manager Ad Unit. This may lead to more targeted impressions and higher CTRs. Lytics identifies your visitor, even if they are anonymous and combines all known information about that particular visitor to improve ad targeting. Technical Overview The following overview is meant to cover the basics, from a technical JavaScript standpoint. If you are not a developer or are not interested in understanding in detail how the integration will work, please skip to Account Configuration below. In order to properly target ads we must ensure that Lytics has loaded the audiences the current visitor is a member of. As such, Lytics will temporarily disable the initial loading of ads using googletag.pubads().disableInitialLoad() . This ensures ads will not load before targeting has completed. A callback will be initialized using the Lytics JavaScript tag. This callback will be notified as soon as the visitors profile has been loaded. This will serve as the mechanism that completes the Ad Manager integration. When the callback is fired Lytics will pass the audiences into Ad Manager using the googletag.pubads().setTargeting() function and then complete the process by triggering a refresh using googletag.pubads().refresh() . This will result in the ads loading properly with the desired targeting criteria. NOTE: Lytics targeting works for all Google Ad Manager tag types except passback tags. Ad Manager Account Configuration The first step in targeting Lytics audiences is to configure Ad Manager to recognize them.  This is done by defining custom \"key-values\". Log in to Ad Manager. Navigate to Inventory in the menu at the left. Select Key-values in the sub-menu. Click New Key . For a Name, use LyticsSegments exactly as shown here (no extra characters, spaces, or different capitalization). For a Values type, select the Users will enter targeting values when creating line items or checking inventory option. Click Save at the bottom. Site Setup & Targeting Now that Ad Manager is configured to recognize Lytics audiences, configure your site to pass that Lytics audience information to Ad Manager using the custom \"Key-values\" for each visitor. Install the Lytics JavaScript Tag as described in our JavaScript documentation. For best performance when working with Ad Manager, place the standard Lytics JavaScript tag above the tags that Google Ad Manager generates. Incorrect placement may cause delays in displaying the proper ad(s) or undesired behavior. Install the additional Google Ad Manager integration tag as outlined below. It is required that his loads AFTER the Lytics JavaScript tag to prevent errors. HTML <!-- lytics for google ad manager -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    var handleGoogleAdManagerSync = function(profile){\n        if(typeof window.googletag === 'undefined'){\n            console.warn('google ad manager expected but not found');\n            return;\n        }\n        if(profile && profile.data && profile.data.user && profile.data.user.segments){\n            window.googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n                window.googletag.pubads().setTargeting(\"LyticsSegments\", profile.data.user.segments);\n                window.googletag.pubads().refresh();\n            });\n        }else{\n            console.warn('unable to load Lytics audiences for Google Ad Manager');\n            window.googletag.pubads().refresh();\n        }\n    }\n    jstag.call('entityReady', handleGoogleAdManagerSync);\n</script> Complete the site setup by installing the Google Ad Manager generated tags per their instructions. Remember, for the optimal experience all additional Google generated code should come after the Lytics code above. For reference, please find a full example of a working installation below: 📘 The following is provided as an example and should not be used in a production environment. Always consult with your web development team to ensure that the configuration is compatible with your specific Google Ad Manager setup. In most cases, tags are not loaded directly on the page but are typically managed through a tag manager. Additionally, it's crucial to avoid loading the same tags in multiple places, as this can lead to unexpected results.

However, client side JavaScript can vary greatly and the Google Ad Manager's tag can be configured inconsistently.  Due to this, it may be necessary to configure the integration using the advanced configuration section below. This commonly resolves flickering, ads not loading, ads loading twice or any other undesired behavior. Advanced Configuration The advanced configuration is intended to give your developer(s) access to visitors' profile and/or current audience membership via the Lytics JavaScript tag. This ensures your developer(s) retain complete control on how the Google Ad Manager integration is performed to ensure it is configured optimally based on your unique source code. Please see Technical Overview section above for a full understanding of how the Ad Manager integration should work at a base level. Ensure ads will not be initialized before the visitors profile has been retrieved. Configure Lytics Profile Callback The Lytics JavaScript tag makes adding a callback easy. Our full JavaScript documentation walks you through the process of creating and managing callbacks. Said callback will be responsible for passing the visitors profile data, including audience membership, back to your desired JavaScript function. The following is an example of the callback used in the default Ad Manager integration. You will see it receives the data object, verifies that it has audiences and handles the result by either passing them to Google or logging a warning to the console. JavaScript var handleGoogleAdManagerSync = function(profile){\n    if(typeof window.googletag === 'undefined'){\n        console.warn('google ad manager expected but not found');\n        return;\n    }\n    if(profile && profile.data && profile.data.user && profile.data.user.segments){\n        window.googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n            window.googletag.pubads().setTargeting(\"LyticsSegments\", profile.data.user.segments);\n            window.googletag.pubads().refresh();\n        });\n    }else{\n        console.warn('unable to load Lytics audiences for Google Ad Manager');\n        window.googletag.pubads().refresh();\n    }\n}\njstag.call('entityReady', handleGoogleAdManagerSync); Push audience membership to Google Ad Manager As shown above, within the callback you will process the data object, full details on what is included can be found here , and ultimately passing a list of audience IDs to Ad Manager using their tags APIs. JavaScript window.googletag.pubads().setTargeting(\"LyticsSegments\", data.segments); Initialize Ads Lastly, once the audience IDs have been pushed, we leverage the googletag.pubads().refresh() call to show the proper ads. This refresh may be unnecessary in your application if you are ensuring the audiences have been pushed before the ads tag has been initialized in the first place. JavaScript window.googletag.pubads().refresh(); Lytics Audience Configuration Next, create your audiences in Lytics. These will be the audiences you will be connecting to \"Line Items\" within Ad Manager in the final step. In Lytics, create an audience using the criteria with which you'd like to target. Ensure the \"Enable API Access\" box is checked, this is what allows it to be shared to your site. Write down the \"ID\" exactly as it appears to the right of the checkbox, you will need this inside of Google Ad Manager. Be precise. Capitalization, symbols, and spacing will need to match exactly. For instance, if you generated an audience called \"Cat-aholics\", later, you won't be successful if you target Ad Manager at \"cataholics\", \"cat-aholics\", or \"Cat- Aholics\". Google Ad Manager Line Item Configuration Finally, configure Ad Manager to map Lytics Audiences to Line items. Log in to Ad Manager. Navigate to Delivery in the menu at the left. Navigate to Line items in the sub-menu. Select a line item you'd like to target at your Lytics Audience. On the Settings tab of the line item you're editing, scroll to the bottom and in the Add Targeting section, select Key-values . Where it says Select a key , select \"LyticsSegments\". Choose the is operator. Enter the ID of the Lytics Audience you created. Again, precision is important, capitalization, symbols, and spacing need to match exactly. Click Save at the bottom. Verify that your selection has been properly saved by navigating away from the line item, then going back and checking that your key-value is there when you look. That's it! Your ads will be targeted to that audience as often as you've set up within Google DFP, which allows ads to be prioritized and rotated.

    "content": "Interest Engines Learn more about Lytics' Interest Engines Suggest Edits Lytics' Interest Engines allow you to analyze, interpret, and incorporate user interests into your marketing activities. While Lytics Interest Engine is primarily used with webpages, Lytics provides 3 kinds of Interest Engines for various use cases and tactics. The Default engine, which examines web data using NLP (Natural language processing) to generate Topics (think keywords, categories, and subjects). This is the standard Interest Engine and requires no out-of-the-box configuration Custom Affinity Engines allow you to link custom fields associated with your content to your users. When incorporating data from Shopify, or offline systems that contain product data, Custom Affinity Engines allow you to associate features/attributes from your inventory with your users. For example, consider a database of articles with genre data. With a Custom Affinity Engine, you can track which genres each of your users has interacted with. Collaborative Filters empower you to recommend items based on what other users do. This is analogous to \"users also bought\", or \"users also read\" recommendations that are often surfaced on Amazon or other websites. Using a Collaborative Filter algorithm, Lytics analyzes user behavior and exposes Recommendations via the Recommendation API. How to use Interest Engines Interest Engines are a rather foreign concept and you may be confused about how this can help improve your marketing initiatives. Keep in mind that the end goal is to gain a better understanding of your users . With Lytics' Interest Engine, there are two commonly used techniques to best utilize this powerful data: Topics & Affinities: With the Default engine and Custom Affinity Engines , you can use the Lytics UI to view the Topic Taxonomy . This visualization displays how your Topics co-occur and relate to each other. The Topic Taxonomy view can be useful to visualize similar Topics, which can be useful in creating Affinities . User Segmentation: Lytics Interest Engines output a new field on the user profile that captures the interests that a user has exhibited. Using this data, you can create high-powered audiences to target users with specific interests using Lytics Audience Builder. Recommendations: Using Lytics' Recommendation API, you can enable personalized recommendations for your users based on their activities. For instance, you can recommend URLs based on a user's browsing history, or recommend products based on a user's purchase history. To get started with Recommendations, check out the Recommendation documentation, or navigate to the Experiences tab. How to Create Interest Engines To create a new Interest Engine, navigate to the Engines page in the Content navigation dropdown, and click on the New Interest Engine button. When clicked, this displays a modal that allows you to select between: Custom Affinity Engine Shopify Engine Collaborative Filter Each option will present you with a wizard to configure the Engine. Please contact Lytics Support if you experience any issues creating your new Interest Engine. Updated 11 months ago Table of Contents How to use Interest Engines How to Create Interest Engines",

    "title": "Collect Mobile Data with Firebase + GTM",
    "content": "Collect Mobile Data with Firebase + GTM Suggest Edits The following tutorial provides step-by-step guidance for setting up, configuring, and testing data collection from a mobile device in real-time using Firebase Analytics (FA) & Google Tag Manager (GTM). This is an excellent alternative for minimizing the number of SDKs that must be deployed from your mobile app by leveraging a robust and well-tested analytics solution in Firebase Analytics using GA4. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the following steps: Setting up Firebase and installing the SDK. Setting up Google Tag Manager and installing the SDK. Configuring the Lytics Image Pixel collection method. Testing the implementation end-to-end. Benefits Events are delivered to Lytics in real-time. Reduces the number of SDKs installed. Leverages Google-managed SDKs to streamline app approval. Easy access to advanced testing and debugging tools. Automatically passes events to Google Analytics or analysis or further delivery to BigQuery. Install Firebase SDK This solution leverages Firebase Analytics which Google Analytics powers under the hood. This means that in addition to getting data delivered to Lytics, you’ll also be able to leverage Google Analytics and its direct integrations to other Google products such as BigQuery as an automatic value add. Google provides thorough documentation for getting a Firebase project set up and installed in your platform of choice. Once you have completed the setup and made it to the Start logging events section of the documentation, you are ready to move to the next step. Feel free to log some sample events per the documentation, either way, we’ll come back here further down in this tutorial. Install Google Tag Manager SDK Next, we’ll leverage Google Tag Manager, which offers seamless integration with Firebase Analytics to forward events collected by Firebase to Lytics. Like Firebase, Google has excellent documentation for getting a Google Tag Manager account set up and the iOS or Android SDKs configured. Sending User Properties & Events Now that we have configured Firebase and Google Tag Manager, we are ready to start configuring and sending our events. Firebase makes both setting user properties as well as passing interaction-based events easy. For more details on the power of Firebase, you can revisit the Start Logging Events section of the getting started documentation. Analytics.logEvent(\"did_something\", parameters: [\n  \"_uid\": UUID().uuidString,\n  \"lytics_test_key\": \"some value\",\n]) The above represents an example of a custom event named did_something . For that event, we also include two parameters _uid and lytics_test_key . These parameters are entirely up to you and should be in support of your use case. Keep a record of the parameters used, as you will need to explicitly define those in Google Tag Manager to pass them to Lytics. That said, including an identifier of some for every event is essential to your identity resolution strategy. In the above example, we use _uid , which is one of the default identifiers. Consult your account manager or solutions team for the optimal approach here. Regardless of the approach, it is essential that the ID(s) passed persist. There are various ways to generate and store a value on the device. For this step, it is best to consult your app development team. One example would be to use Swift's UUID to generate a unique user identifier and store it using UserDefaults . The method used to generate, store, and access this value has no impact on the results. It is only essential to include that value in all events and have it persist for as long as possible. On that note, whenever possible, it is a best practice to include multiple identifiers such as email, or IDFA, to maximize the match rate. Configuring Google Tag Manager for Event Forwarding The final step in getting user details from your app to Lytics is configuring your Google Tag Manager Container. We’ll start by defining Variables for each of the parameters you pass in your events from your app. Based on our example, we’ll define two variables: _uid and lytics_test_key. Step One From the Google Tag Manager dashboard, navigate to Variables in the left-hand menu. Step Two Create a new variable, one for each parameter, using the New button. In the new window that loads, click Choose a variable type and select Event Parameter . This is just an example, you can use any variable type based on your needs. Event Name may also prove helpful in adding more context to the event data delivered to Lytics. Step Three Finish your variable configuration by selecting Custom Parameter , followed by inputting one of the parameter names we defined above. In our case, we’ll use _uid with a default value of an empty string. Save your settings and move to the next parameter until you have created a variable for all parameters being passed to Lytics. Step Four With your variables defined, we’ll move on to creating a new Tag within our container. Select Tags from the left-hand menu and New tag once the list of tags has loaded. On the following window, click Choose a tag type and select Custom Image . Step Five With your tag type selected, we’ll configure the Image URL as well as the Triggering rules. The Image URL will leverage the Lytics Image Pixel collection method. To configure, you’ll need to know your Account ID . For simplicity, we’ll break the full URL into two parts that will be joined together in actual execution. Focusing first on the path, everything from https up to the ? you will need to replace the YOUR-AID portion of the path with your actual account ID and the STREAM portion of the path to your desired ingest stream. https://c.lytics.io/c/YOUR-AID/STREAM The query parameters will contain the field name you’d like to pass to Lytics, as well as a value that is populated by referencing the GTM variables. ?_uid={{Lytics UID}}&lytics_test_key={{Lytics Test Key}} Putting those two parts together results in the final value of the Image URL in our config. https://c.lytics.io/c/myaccountid123/mobileevents?_uid={{Lytics UID}}&lytics_test_key={{Lytics Test Key}} Last we’ll configure the event that triggers our forward by selecting All Events . Step Six With our tag defined, the final step is publishing the Google Tag Manager container and storing the config that is generated in the proper directory of our App. Once again, Google provides instructions for doing so. Test & Debug Implementation With our implementation all configured, the final step is to test and debug. Each of the steps defined above supports testing and debugging. We’ve added quick links to those resources below. Firebase Event Debugger Google Tag Manager Debugger Lytics Data Streams: Once successfully tested, you can do the final validation by reviewing your incoming data as part of the streams UI within your Lytics account.

    "url": "https://docs.lytics.com/docs/integrated-marketing-tools",
    "title": "Integration Patterns",
    "content": "Integration Patterns Suggest Edits Overview Lytics offers pre-built integrations for many of today’s most popular marketing tools to ease the onboarding and exporting of data. These integrations are available in the Data tab of the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs . Each of these marketing tools has specific instructions for setup found in our integrations documentation. Types The implementation type refers to the development methods used to implement the job. Usually this depends on the third-party provider's capabilities and the resources they provide to outside developers such as APIs or SDKs. Integrations may be client-side or server-side. Client-side Integrations Client-side integrations are implemented in browser-facing code. These are implemented through the Lytics JavaScript tag and usually require you to have a tag from the third-party provider also installed on your web page. Given the nature of these integrations being tightly coupled to the browser session, these integrations collect and send data in real time. There are two types of client-side integrations: Push Integrations A push integration pushes data from Lytics, such as surfaced fields or audience membership of users to the third party. Examples of push integrations include personalization tools such as Pathfora SDK which uses Lytics user data to personalize the page with content based on audience membership, or data management platforms (DMPs) such as Krux, which transmits Lytics user information to the DMP. Pull Integrations A pull integration pulls data from the third party and imports it into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider, and the exact fields available in the audience builder will be listed in the respective integration document. An example of this type of integration includes the Lytics JavaScript tag communicating with a data layer object on your website to collect data from various third-party vendors such as Tealium or even a custom implementation. Server-to-server Integrations Server-side integrations allow Lytics and the third-party service to communicate directly, usually in the form of a job. These jobs are available to set up and execute in the Lytics platform under Data > Jobs . There are two main types of Server-side integrations: Import Integrations As the name implies, import integrations ingest data into Lytics. This data will differ based on the provider and job type. It can be anything from identifying information, demographic data, subscription status, or activity data for a user. Examples of import integrations include the Amplitude Cohorts Import which imports user data from Amplitude. Export Integrations Export integrations send user profile data from Lytics to a third-party tool, usually at the audience level. You can select which audience(s) you want to export, and include user data such as user fields, audience membership and more such as the SendGrid User Export. However, some integrations may export raw event data or metrics for monitoring such as the BigQuery Event Export or the New Relic Insights Monitoring job. Enrichment Integrations An enrichment integration uses a third-party service to enhance and enrich existing user profiles within Lytics. These integrations require Lytics to push a list of user identifiers (defined by an audience of known users) to a third-party enrichment tool. That tool then returns additional data on that user such as information on the user's company (for B2B marketing), or additional demographic and social data. Examples of enrichment integrations include Full Contact Audience Enrichment and Clearbit User Enrichment jobs. Many providers support both import and export job types for a complete two-way data sync between Lytics and the third-party tool. Implementation Techniques Client and server-side integrations may be implemented in a number of different ways. The implementation technique often determines factors such as Tier, Frequency, and Resulting Data. Client-side Implementations JavaScript Tag All default client-side integrations somehow utilize the Lytics JavaScript tag. The tag implements functions for sending data to a data stream and receiving user profile data which has been surfaced. Behind the scenes, these functions utilize some of the public Lytics API endpoints. Server-side Implementations APIs API integrations utilize REST or SOAP APIs the third-party vendor provides to send or receive data. The specific endpoints used are listed in the documentation for the integration. Lytics prefers to integrate with third parties via API as it provides a deeper out-of-the-box integration. Audience Triggers Audience triggers are used in conjunction with an API implementation for export or enrichment job types. Audience triggers are powered by an internal system called subscriptions. Subscriptions listen to specific events, such as when a user has entered or exited an audience. A subscription can then send a trigger to any job listening to the subscription. Once received, the job can push the updated user data to the third-party tool via APIs. This process enables real-time exports versus a scheduled batch export. File-Based Transfer Lytics supports file-based import and export jobs. Files may be obtained or pushed to a server via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) . SFTP integrations may be provided for third-party vendors who do not have API capabilities or as part of a custom integration. Lytics has a managed SFTP server that can be used to transfer files, or it may retrieve files from a third-party SFTP server. Another example of a file-based export is via Email Attachment , such as the CSV Email Export. Webhooks Many third-party vendors offer webhooks or API callbacks, which send requests containing relevant user-activity data to another service after an event has occurred in the system. The Lytics API has a collection endpoint that can be used as a destination for third-party webhooks. Providers that support webhooks will have documentation detailing the preferred setup method for Lytics to receive webhook data. In addition, Lytics supports webhooks that can be configured to send user-level events, such as real-time audience membership updates. Frequency Frequency describes when and how often that data is sent or received. It attempts to answer common questions such as: \"When will I see data in my tool?\" and \"Can I keep my data up-to-date?\" Lytics integrations are either real-time or scheduled. Real-time A number of different integration types are considered real-time (or \"near\" real-time). In that, user data is sent or received downstream as soon as the data is available in the native system. The following types of integrations are considered real-time: Client-Side Integrations - All client-side integrations are considered real-time unless otherwise stated in the documentation. Data collected via a pull integration is captured in the browser while the user performs actions, and push integrations always contain the most up-to-date data from the user profile. Webhooks - As stated above, webhooks are API calls that happen after an event has occurred, often used to notify downstream tools. Jobs Using Triggers - As stated above, jobs utilizing triggers receive and may push events downstream in real-time. Depending on rate limits or other such limitations of the third-party in question, the job may queue a small batch of events over a short amount of time before sending them, hence \"near\" real-time. Backfill Jobs that use audience triggers also often have an option to perform a backfill of users. Without a backfill, only new users who enter the audience after the time of job setup will be processed. Enabling a one-time backfill as part of the job configuration will immediately process a batch of all existing users in the audience to the third-party tool and then rely on real-time triggers to update user information once the backfill is finished. Some jobs support this feature as a configurable option. If so, it is listed under the \"Frequency\" section of \"Integration Details\" in a job's documentation. Batch Batch integrations send or receive user data in larger batches. Depending on the configuration of the job, it may only import/export a single batch of users once, or it may run continuously, checking for new users and updates to existing user data. One-time run - You may want to run a one-time job to import, export, or enrich users at a specific point in time. For example, if you're running a one-time promotional blast email to a unique audience, exporting your audience once before sending the email would make sense. Continuous Update - Many batch jobs support a configuration option for continuous updates which will re-run the job on some cadence (hourly, daily, weekly, etc). This is common for import jobs for providers that don't support webhooks, as Lytics will want to keep the user profiles up to date with what is available in the third party. Scheduled - Some jobs may support specific scheduled run times, which can be especially helpful for continuous updates. It allows you to specify the time of day the job should run and the timezone. Resulting Data The final way Lytics categorizes integrations is by the type of data it handles and how the job output is perceived. The resulting export and push integration data will vary based on the structures supported by the provider tool, and each integration will document the specific output type. Here is a list of common data types in Lytics for import and pull integrations: User Profiles When you import users, you will likely see new user profiles created for users that previously did not have data associated with them in Lytics. However, you may also see updates to existing users' profiles, if Lytics is able to recognize an existing user based on the identity resolution strategy for your account. User Fields The new user fields that are created as part of an integration are listed in the \"Fields\" section of each doc. These fields will be added to new and existing user profiles as described in the section above, and they will become available for segmentation in the audience builder. Raw Event Data If data is imported to Lytics without being mapped by LQL, this data is stored as raw fields in data streams, which are un-actionable. For example, if you are importing custom data via CSV, you will need queries in place for the raw data to be meaningful. In addition, some pre-built integrations may import additional fields that are not mapped as part of the default queries provided by the out-of-the-box integration. You may contact support for assistance with mapping these fields. Content In addition to user data, some integrations may ingest content that can be analyzed and processed by the Lytics Content Affinity Engine. An example of this is the MailChimp Import which, in addition to user data, brings in content from your MailChimp email campaigns. This content can help inform affinity scores for users who have viewed and interacted with the email. Metrics This is an uncommon pattern in existing integrations, but Lytics can also import specific metrics from third-party tools. For example, in the Goal Canvas, Facebook Experience metrics are imported directly from the Facebook Insights API. Metrics that are imported to Lytics are accessible via the Metrics API. PGP Encryption File imports and exports can be decrypted and encrypted, respectively using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). To create or ingest PGP encrypted files, use an authorization that includes PGP keys. PGP Public Key authorizations are used to encrypt exports. PGP Private Key authorizations are used to decrypt imports. Follow the instructions below when creating a PGP authorization. PGP Public Key Use a PGP Public Key authorization to encrypt file exports. You will need to generate an armored PGP key pair if you haven't already. In the PGP Public Key field, enter your public key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following: -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored. PGP Private Key Use a PGP Private Key authorization to decrypt file imports. You will need the private key that is paired with the public key used to encrypt the file. In the PGP Private Key field, enter your private key. Be sure to include the header and footer of the armored key. This means your entry should begin and end with the following: -----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- and -----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK----- If your key does not begin and end with these strings respectively, it is possible it has not been ASCII armored. If your private key has been protected with a passphrase, enter the passphrase in the field labeled PGP Private Key Passphrase . If your private key is not passphrase protected, leave this field empty. Note : in order for Lytics to decrypt the file successfully, you will need to provide the private key that is paired with the public key that was used to encrypt the file. Templating User profile fields can be dynamically inserted into an alert using  templating of supported fields including the alert title, alert subtitle, and alert body fields. Lytics uses Golang's template package to provide this functionality. The data available to you will vary based on the data available on each individual profile. You can download a customer profile to see a list of fields available on your user profiles. For example, if you want to include a user's name in an alert and the field containing the name is called first_name , a template like the following could be used: Hey, {{ .first_name }} Notice the \".\" before the name of the profile field. Some profiles may not have a first-name field. To avoid sending an incoherent alert when you don't have the first name field available, a template like the following could be used: {{ if .first_name }}Hey, {{ .first_name }}{{ else }}I wish I knew you{{ end }} Alternatively, if you would rather include a default name when the field does not exist on the profile, a template like the following could be used: Hey, {{.last_name | default \"valued customer\"}} If you would like to make sure that multiple fields on a profile exist, a template like the following could be used: {{ if and .first_name .last_name }}Hey, {{ .first_name }} {{ .last_name }}{{ else }}I don't know you{{ end }} To check equality on a particular profile field, you can create a template like the following: {{ if eq .subscriber_status “subscribed” }}You are a subscriber!{{ else }}You should subscribe!{{ end }} Updated over 1 year ago Table of Contents Overview Types Client-side Integrations Server-to-server Integrations Implementation Techniques Client-side Implementations Server-side Implementations Frequency Real-time Backfill Batch Resulting Data User Profiles User Fields Raw Event Data Content Metrics PGP Encryption PGP Public Key PGP Private Key Templating",

    "title": "Google Cloud Pub/Sub",
    "content": "Google Cloud Pub/Sub Suggest Edits Overview Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully-managed messaging service that lets you send and receive messages in real-time between independent applications. This integration supports both importing and exporting data using Cloud Pub/Sub in real-time. Importing data results in a continuous update of new users or existing user profiles supplemented with activity data. This differs from other import integrations that usually only import once every hour or every day. You can then use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns. Exporting data results in a continuous update of new and existing user profiles on a Pub/Sub Topic of your choice. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up a Google Cloud Pub/Sub account before you begin the process below. You will use a service account to access your Cloud Pub/Sub data. See Google's authentication documentation for details on the differences between user accounts and service accounts. To authorize this integration, you will need to authenticate by creating a service account JWT JSON token. Configure service account You will need a service account credential file to use this authorization type. If you do not have one, follow the instructions in Google's documentation to create one. You will need to give Lytics one of the following roles depending on how you want to configure your workflow: Pub/Sub Admin level permissions allows Lytics to create and receive new subscriptions without any problems. Pub/Sub Editor level permissions will also work. For importing into Lytics, the following IAM roles need to be added to the service account: pubsub.topics.list pubsub.topics.get pubsub.subscriptions.get pubsub.subscriptions.consume pubsub.topics.attachSubscription pubsub.subscriptions.create (Optional, but you must provide an existing subscription if your role does not have this action.) For exporting events to PubSub, you will need the following IAM roles added to the service account: pubsub.topics.list pubsub.topics.get pubsub.topics.publish pubsub.topics.create (Optional, but you must provide an existing topic if your role does not have this action.) Authorize integration If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Google Cloud from the list of providers. Select the Cloud Pub/Sub Service Account JWT method. Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. In the Cert JSON textbox, copy the contents of your service account's credential file. Click Save Authorization . Import Events Importing user and activity data from Cloud Pub/Sub in real-time results in new users or existing user profiles supplemented with activity data. You can use this data to build and refine your existing Lytics audiences to power better, cross-channel campaigns. The integration is similar to AWS Kinesis Streaming or Azure Event Hubs. It requires you to set up a Cloud Pub/Sub Topic , which you publish JSON messages to. Lytics then listens (subscribes) to this Topic and receives those messages. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration Frequency : Real-time Integration Resulting data : Raw Event Data, User Field s, and Content (if mapped). This integration utilizes the Cloud Pub/Sub API methods of receiving events from a publisher. Specifically we use the Golang library . You are the publisher who sends (publishes) events through a user-created object known as a Topic. Lytics manages an object called a Subscription, which receives the data (events) from the Topic you created. The continuously running job works like this: Through the service account token you created in the authorization step, Lytics creates a new client , which manages and receives events using the subscription. Lytics verifies the Topic ID you provide in the job configuration, and creates a connection to the Subscription associated with this Topic. If no Subscription exists or is provided, Lytics creates a new Subscription in the following format: lytics\\_subscription\\_RANDOM_WORKFLOW_ID . The Topic is the \"publisher\", whereas the Subscription is the \"receiver\". This means you must publish/send data to this Topic from your account, which Lytics will then receive and process. The job will continue to get events in real-time as soon as events are published on the Topic. The events are sent to a user-selected stream which then gets added to user profiles or creates new user profiles. Fields Data imported by this job will be sent to a new or existing data stream in your account which you can define as part of the configuration. You will need to map the raw event data into user or content fields. You may reach out to Lytics Support for assistance with mapping your custom data. Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an import of events from Google Cloud Pub/Sub into Lytics. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Data Sources documentation for more information. Select Google CLoud from the list of providers. Select the Import Data (Cloud Pub/Sub) job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. In the Stream text box, either select or type in the stream you would like to send these events to. Enter the Topic ID you would like Lytics to receive events from. (Optional) Enter an existing Subscription Name that you would like to receive events on or leave it blank and Lytics will create a new one named lytics_subscription_RANDOM_ID . By default, after 100 bad messages (usually because they are not JSON), the job will error. If you would like to change the maximum number of bad messages before the job errors, enter a number under Max Bad Messages . Click Start Import . Export Audience Exporting user data to Cloud Pub/Sub allows you to receive real-time audience updates from Lytics on a Pub/Sub Topic in your Google Cloud account. The integration is similar to Webhooks Audience Triggers. You can either create a topic for Lytics to push to, or the integration can be configured to create one automatically. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration - Audience Trigger Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration Resulting data : Messages on a Pub/Sub Topic. The data attribute of the Pub/Sub messages will be formatted as shown below. Once configured, the export job will run as follows: Confirm the configured Topic ID exists. If it does not and you have selected Create Topic , the job will attempt to create one under the Topic ID configured. Listen for Audience changes. When a user enters or exits the audience, the event is packaged into a Pub/Sub Message and published to the Topic. Fields By default, the integration will populate the data attribute of its Pub/Sub messages with all user fields in a JSON payload of the following format: JSON {\n    \"id\": \"7076027172059065053\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"_created\": \"2020-07-15T08:55:43.041-07:00\",\n        \"_cust_sz\": 118,\n        \"_internal_sz\": 33,\n        \"_modified\": \"2020-07-15T08:55:43.041-07:00\",\n        \"_num_aliases\": 1,\n        \"_num_conflicts\": 0,\n        \"_num_days\": 1,\n        \"_num_events\": 1,\n        \"_num_streams\": 1,\n        \"_split\": 12,\n        \"_streamnames\": [\n            \"default\"\n        ],\n        \"_total_sz\": 151,\n        \"channels\": [\n            \"web\"\n        ],\n        \"email\": \" [email protected] \",\n        \"first_name\": \"Beth\",\n        \"firstvisit_ts\": \"2020-07-15T08:55:43.041-07:00\",\n        \"hourly\": {\n            \"15\": 1\n        },\n        \"hourofweek\": {\n            \"87\": 1\n        },\n        \"is_bot\": \"f\",\n        \"is_mobile\": \"t\",\n        \"last_active_ts\": \"2020-07-15T08:55:43.041-07:00\",\n        \"last_channel_activities\": {\n            \"web\": \"2020-07-15T08:55:43.041-07:00\"\n        },\n        \"last_name\": \"Izzi\",\n        \"lastvisit_ts\": \"2020-07-15T08:55:43.041-07:00\",\n        \"name\": \"Beth Izzi\",\n        \"score_frequency\": 99,\n        \"score_intensity\": 0,\n        \"score_momentum\": 99,\n        \"score_propensity\": 0,\n        \"score_quantity\": 100,\n        \"score_recency\": 100,\n        \"segment_events\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"42976a269a5e6b9d06c681b1c27292df\",\n                \"event\": \"enter\",\n                \"slug\": \"emailzz5\",\n                \"enter\": \"2020-10-14T13:27:33.916374949-07:00\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"user_agent\": \"python-requests\",\n        \"user_attributes\": {\n            \"value\": \"681\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"object\": \"user\",\n        \"subscription_id\": \"36e243f8fd8f4530bbd330fa7fb1a685\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2020-10-14T13:27:34.038154562-07:00\"\n    }\n} Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export job for Google Cloud Pub/Sub in Lytics.

    "content": "1. Install the Lytics Tag Suggest Edits Installing the Tag In the Web SDK, Lytics provides a tag that can be placed on your site to collect behavioral data and surface the materialized profile back to your browser in real time. Manual installation instructions are available from within the app at Data Pipeline > SDK > Web SDK . If your site is a Drupal or Wordpress site, or you use Google Tag Manager we recommend using one of these turnkey methods to install the Lytics Tag: Drupal For Drupal users, getting up and running is as simple as installing the official Lytics Drupal module . Once you have the module added to your site using composer or another preferred method, you will want to complete the following configuration steps: Visit the Configuration page either from the module details in the Extend section of Drupal or directly from the Configuration section ( /en/admin/config/system/lytics ). Add a valid API Token for your Lytics account. Be sure to give that token admin privileges, as that will unlock account verification and direct access to all Lytics systems responsible for surfacing and managing profiles and personalization. This token should also have no expiration, as it will need continued access to your Lytics account. For more information visit our Access Token documentation . With your token entered. Ensure the Enable Tab setting is selected. This will automatically place the Lytics JavaScript SDK onto all public pages of your site. Upon saving configuration , your account details will be surfaced. Be sure to verify that your token is for the Lytics account you are currently configuring. That's it! WordPress A formal WordPress plugin is currently under development and coming soon. Google Tag Manager From the left-hand navigation to select Data Pipeline > SDK > Web SDK . Setup and install Google Tag Manager. Create a new Custom HTML tag and place the Lytics JavaScript snippet into the text box. Ensure the tag is triggered on the pages you desire. We recommend using the All Pages default trigger to start. Submit and publish your Google Tag Manager version. Testing the Lytics Tag Installation Once the tag has been installed, validate a successful installation via one of the three following methods: Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension (Recommended) The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above: Open the extension and ensure it has been activated. The interface will display a message to confirm the correct installation of the Lytics tag and relevant configuration details. In-app Verification Assistant We've built a simple tool to validate that data flows into your Lytics account. Please note that the collected events may take a few minutes to reflect in the UI. Select Vault using the product switcher at the top left. Use the left-hand navigation to select Setup > JavaScript Tag At the bottom of the page Setup click the refresh button to validate installation if it does not already state Successfully installed . Manually If you prefer to verify the installation manually, you can do so by opening the Chrome developer console and ensuring jstag is accessible. In addition, by viewing the network tab, you can monitor data collection requests being sent to lytics.io/c and personalization requests being loaded from lytics.io/api/personalize Testing the Current Visitor's Profile via JavaScript SDK The final step to verify installation is ensuring you can access your visitor profile. This profile is built and delivered in real-time as you engage with content. Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension (Recommended) The Lytics Dev Tools Chrome Extension makes validation and exploration simple. Once you've installed the extension as outlined above: Open the extension and ensure it has been activated. Access Profile from the bottom menu in the Chrome extension. This section of the extension profiles two views into your profile. The first is the Summary showcasing available attributes and affinities. The second is the Details , which profiles a raw JSON dump of all available attributes and insights accessible via the Personalization Engine web SDK. Manually If you prefer to verify the installation manually, you can do so by opening the Chrome developer console and ensuring jstag is accessible.

    "title": "Mobile Messaging with Lytics Webhooks and Serverless Functions",
    "content": "Mobile Messaging with Lytics Webhooks and Serverless Functions Suggest Edits Lytics webhooks paired with serverless functions are a great way to build custom workflows to power your marketing campaigns. This workflow is very flexible and can be configured as a trigger for a variety of platforms to send emails, push notifications, and alerts. This example uses a serverless cloud function to send a text message to a non-subscribed user when they become highly engaged via Twilio . Setup the audience In this example, you’re going to send a personalized text message to a user when they become highly engaged determined by Lytics behavioral scores . Additionally, you only want to send messages to non-subscribed users who have a phone number. Therefore, you are going to need to create an audience with three criteria. First, only users who are (or become) deeply engaged based on Lytics data-science scores. Second, their profile has a phone number. And third, they are not yet a subscriber as the text message will include a sign up link. In the audience builder, you're going to use an existing audience for highly engaged users and two custom rules for subscribers and phone numbers. For additional instructions on building audiences, check out the audience builder docs . NOTE: Twilio's API requires phone numbers with a country code (e.g. +11234567890). If phone numbers are not stored in this format in the user's Lytics profile the cloud function can be used to correctly format the number. Create the cloud function This example uses Google Cloud Functions to power this custom workflow, however this will work just as well with other serverless tools like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. For a quickstart on Google Cloud Functions see Quickstart: Using the gcloud Command-Line Tool . The Lytics webhook sends the full profile of a user when they enter or exit the audience. The code below receives the profile in the body of the request, then uses the Twilio API to send a custom text message to the user. Note: You'll also need a Twilio account . When using a Twilio free trial, you can only send text messages to the numbers in your Verified Phone Number list . // Twilio Client\nconst accountSid = process.env.ACCOUNT_SID;\nconst authToken = process.env.AUTH_TOKEN;\nconst client = require('twilio')(accountSid, authToken);\n\nexports.sms = (req, res) => {\n const r = req.body; \n \n // Do not send a text message when the user exits the audience\n if (r.data.segment_events[0].event === \"exit\") {\n  res.status(200).end();\n  return;\n } \n \n const from = 'your twilio number';\n const to = r.data.phone_number;\n const body = `Hey ${r.data.first_name || 'there'}, we thought you might be interested in subscribing. As an added bonus, here is a link to get your first month free: your_link.com?uid=${r.data._uid}`\n\n // Send the message\n client.messages\n  .create({ from, to, body })\n  .then(message => console.log(message.sid))\n  .then(res.status(200).end('success'))\n  .catch(err => res.status(500).end(`error: ${err}`));\n} Next, deploy the function. You can get your account_sid and auth_token from the Twilio dashboard. gcloud functions deploy sms --set-env-vars ACCOUNT_SID=<your_account_sid>,AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token> --runtime nodejs8 --trigger-http After deploying the cloud function, you will be provided with an endpoint that triggers the function. You can also find this in the Cloud Functions console: Create the Webhook Next, you need to export the audience previously created. Return to Lytics and navigate to Data > Integrations and select Webhooks . Next, click New Workflow then Segment Triggers Webhook , select the audience created previously moving it to the right column, enter the url trigger for your cloud function into the Webhook URL field, and click Start Export . You should received a message that your webhook was successfully created. When a user enters or exits the selected audience, the Lytics webhook will send a POST request to the provided URL, triggering the cloud function. That’s it! You’ve successfully created a webhook trigger that will automatically send a text message to unsubscribed users when they enter the highly engaged audience.

    "content": "Amazon SQS Suggest Edits Overview Export Lytics trigger events to AWS SQS .  A Lytics trigger is an event that is raised and available for export when a user enters or leaves a segment for example  \"User x just entered at_risk_to_churn\". AWS SQS can be used for a variety of use cases such as: Use a Lytics trigger \"User at risk to churn\" (user enters the segment at risk to churn) to send an AWS Pinpoint message . Use a Lytics user profile update to write user profiles to an AWS database service such as Redshift , RDS , or DynamoDB for further analysis. Use a Lytics user profile update to send to AWS Lambda for custom scoring and then returning the event score back to lytics. Authorization If you haven't already done so, you will need to set up an AWS SQS account before you begin the process described below. If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Amazon Web Services from the list of providers. Select the AWS Keys method for authorization. Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. Enter your Access Key and Secret Key . Click Save Authorization . Export Activity Data Export triggers to AWS SQS when users enter or exit selected audiences. Integration Details Summary Frequency Real-time Triggers (when event occurs for user) Exports to JSON record of user with event info on which segments they entered or left. Fields Configuration Follow these steps to set up an (import/export/enrichment) job for (provider name). Select Amazon Web Services from the list of providers.

(Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your jo Complete the required fields: Audience(s) : Select which Lytics audiences to emit events from. SQS URL Stream : Enter the AWS SQS stream url you have created and granted Lytics access to.  IT will be in format like this: https://us-east-2.queue.amazonaws.com/111111111/test_lytics_sqs Region : Select the AWS region that the SQS stream resides in. Event/User Attributes : The user profile fields to use for SQS message attributes.  (see sqs documentation for message attributes). Existing Users : Should we go back and find all user's currently in segment, and raise an event for them, then raise events in future for all users as they occur in real time?  True means yes, back fill all current users.  False means only raise events for users in the future as they occur. Message format for Subscription Events When a user profile is updated, it may be due to: A new data event. Scoring gets updated ocassionally. A scheduled trigger evaluation. A trigger of \"has not logged in last 7 days\" may get scheduled to be evaluated 7 days after last x event. When the user gets updated, segment membership is reevaluated and segments a user has moved into or out of triggers a message. Here is an example of the message that is produced.

    "title": "Recommendations",
    "content": "Recommendations Suggest Edits Content Recommendations Content Recommendations are a powerful tool that can be used to increase user engagement by presenting users with relevant content that resonates with them. By utilizing the Lytics topic taxonomy and powerful Machine-Learning algorithms, Lytics can make data-driven Content Recommendations within milliseconds. Powered by over 500 features, and the flexibility to customize your recommendations, Lytics' Content Recommendation API removes the heavy lifting when it comes to content personalization via web, email, etc. Out of the box, Lytics' Content Recommendations can be leveraged in 3 ways: Content Recommendations in the Lytics UI The Lytics UI offers multiple ways to test, validate, and get started with Content Recommendations. Both the Interest Engine page and the Content Collection page provide options for fetching recommendations for individual users. Recommendations via the Interest Engine Page To access Recommendations from the Interest Engine page, navigate to the Interest Engine page under the Content navigation menu, select an Interest Engine, and click on the Recommend tab.  After entering a user ID and clicking Recommend, Lytics will generate recommendations tailored to that specific user. Recommendations via the Collections Page To access Collection-specific recommendations, navigate to a Collection under the Collections page in the Content menu and select the Recommendations tab. This page provides options for creating Recommendations Experiences , links to the Content Recommendation API , code snippets, and a search bar to fetch Collection-specific Recommendations for a user. Recommend content with Lytics Personalization You can create personalized, customizable recommendation experiences on any site where the Lytics JavaScript tag is installed. Recommend content with Pathfora JS Pathfora JS is capable of taking a content collection and fetching and displaying the recommended content for the current user. Read more about it in the Pathfora JS Docs . Recommend content with Lytics APIs The Lytics content recommendation API takes a handful of parameters, including the user the recommendation is for and an optional content collection to recommend from. Using content collections in recommendations Content collections are commonly used in content recommendations. By selecting a content collection as the source of your content recommendation, you're limiting which content the recommendation engine can select from. This is desirable for most use cases, because by default Lytics will scrape any and all pages of your website that users are visiting. Without a content collection defined, the recommendation engine will return what is most relevant to the user regardless of the context. For example, in a marketing context you wouldn't want to promote your careers page, even if it is the most relevant piece of content to the user in question. Size of the collection is also an important factor when using a collection for recommendation. The more content the recommendations engine has access to, the better, more personalized recommendations it can serve. If you can, try to make sure your content collection is of a decent size, and at the minimum fits the following requirements: Documents are valid (return a 200-status from an HTTP get request) Documents have been enriched by Lytics Documents have topics associated with them If none of the documents in your collection fit these conditions, the recommendation engine may have issues returning recommendations as it doesn't have enough information to make a recommendation. If you would like assistance setting up these filters in your collection or to set up a collection with content published less than 1 week in the past, contact Lytics Support . Content collections in Lytics Experiences When setting up a recommended content Experience through the Lytics UI, you will be asked to select an existing content collection or build a new collection to use in the experience. Using collections in custom content recommendations If you're using the Lytics API to recommend content, you can use the contentsegment query parameter to define the content collection you want to use. The value of this parameter should be the ID of the content collection. You can locate the ID of the collection from the URL on the summary page. The ID will come after /collections/ in the URL, and will end before the beginning of the query parameters. Affinity Alignment Score When building a recommendation-based Experience, you have access to the affinity alignment score automatically calculated by Lytics. The “alignment” score measures the similarity between the selected Content Collection and the Audience. This similarity is based upon the “vector similarity” of the most prevalent topics in the Collection, and the most prevalent topics in the Audience. If the Collection and the Audience share many of the same topics, the “alignment” score will be high. Conversely, if the Collection and the Audience share few or no topics, then the “alignment” score will be low. For successful Content Recommendations, we recommend pairing Collections and Audiences with moderate to high alignment. If there is low alignment, Content Recommendations may have low conversion rates and may be irrelevant to users in the selected Audience.

    "content": "Capture More Information from Qualified Leads Suggest Edits Converting a user from unknown to known is a key part of many marketing journeys. You can use Lytics web Experiences to capture user information. While email is a great starting point, you may want to collect a bit more information from your user when they subscribe to your brand. In this guide, you will learn how to create a widget with a custom form component. The example will offer users to subscribe to an newsletter email, and will include an email input field as well as list of checkboxes that can be used to select which topics to subscribe to. You can download the complete JavaScript configuration, CSS, and API override command for this example from the Github examples repository . Currently in the Lytics UI, you may only choose to include the following fields in your capture leads form: Email (Email input) Name (Text input) Job Title (Text input) Company (Text input) Phone Number (Text input) Message (Text area) Country (Select box) However, with the Pathfora SDK, or using API overrides, you can include any custom field of the following types: Text input Email input Text area Select box Checkboxes Radio buttons JavaScript Configuration Begin with a configuration for a form widget . Without defining any field customizations, Pathfora will default to using legacy form elements. However, you will be using custom form elements in this guide. JavaScript var customFormWidget = window.pathfora.Form({\n  id: \"custom-form-widget\",\n  layout: \"slideout\",\n  position: \"bottom-left\",\n  className: \"custom-form-widget\",\n  headline: \"Sign up for our Newsletter\",\n  okMessage: \"Subscribe\"\n});\n\nwindow.pathfora.initializeWidgets([customFormWidget]); This config will generate a simple slideout with a form containing some default fields. Once you have an idea of what form elements you want to include in your widget, you may use the form builder drag and drop UI provided in the Pathfora documentation to construct the form you wish to display. Each field can be marked as required and may have a label and name (used for as the primary key for tracking the field in Lytics and other external systems). Text fields may also include placeholder text, and for fields with multiple options you may define the display text and value of each option. Once you click Save , the builder will output the formElements field that you can simply copy and paste into your widget config. This UI is intended to help you save time when constructing configurations with custom forms. JavaScript var customFormWidget = window.pathfora.Form({\n  // widget configuration\n  formElements: [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"label\": \"Email Address\",\n      \"name\": \"email\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"checkbox-group\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"label\": \"Which feeds would you like to subscribe to?\",\n      \"name\": \"subscription_feeds\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"label\": \"Beauty & Perfumes\",\n          \"value\": \"beauty\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"label\": \"Electronics\",\n          \"value\": \"electronics\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"label\": \"Fashion\",\n          \"value\": \"fashion\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}); Styling Tweaks You may style the form using custom CSS . The example in this guide applies some small CSS changes to adjust the size and spacing of elements within the widget. Remember you can download the code for this example to get the complete JavaScript, CSS, and API override. This can act as a starting point for your own custom form widget Once you've tested and are happy with the look and feel of your form slideout, it's time for the most important step: defining the Lytics audience that should receive this experience. Defining the Lytics Audience The example widget in this guide will be targeted at an audience of anonymous users with a high intensity . Remember to update your config with the audience slug you wish to serve the widget to. Alternatively, you may build your widget as a web personalize Experience with the Capture Leads tactic in the Lytics UI and apply the formElements setting with an API override.

    "title": "Amazon Pinpoint",
    "content": "Amazon Pinpoint Suggest Edits Overview Amazon Pinpoint is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send push notifications, emails, SMS text messages, and voice messages. Integrating Lytics with Amazon Pinpoint allows you to import email, SMS, and push activity from Amazon Pinpoint and then export Lytics cross-channel, behavioral-driven audiences to deliver personalized marketing campaigns. Authorization If you have not already done so, you will need to set up an Amazon Pinpoint account before you begin the process described below. For more information on obtaining your AWS keys for authorization, see Amazon's documentation on secret and access keys . If you are new to creating authorizations in Lytics, see the Authorizations documentation for more information. Select Amazon Web Services from the list of providers. Select the AWS Keys method for authorization. Enter a Label to identify your authorization. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your authorization. Enter your Access Key and Secret Key . Click Save Authorization . Import Activity Data Import email, push, or mobile activity from Amazon Pinpoint to add behavior data to your user profiles in Lytics. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration Resulting data : Raw event data Importing Pinpoint activity into Lytics requires setting up an export of Pinpoint Events to Kinesis. See Amazon's documentation for more information, and follow these instructions to set it up via the Pinpoint UI. This integration uses the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Service APIs to get Pinpoint activity records from the Kinesis stream in near real-time. You can then start the Pinpoint import job in Lytics. Once the import is started, the Pinpoint events will be continuously read off the Kinesis stream into Lytics in near real-time. Data is pulled from Kinesis via the GetRcords endpoint . The activity data will be ingested into the Lytics data stream pinpoint_activity . Fields The following fields are included in the default mapping of the pinpoint_activity stream: Source Field Conditional Lytics User Field Description Type endpoint.Status pinpoint_status Pinpoint Endpoint Status string count(event_type) IF eq(event_type, \"click\") pinpoint_clickct Pinpoint Click Count int count(event_type) IF eq(event_type, \"_email.open\") pinpoint_openct Pinpoint Open Count int count(event_type) IF eq(event_type, \"_email.send\") pinpoint_sendct Pinpoint Send Count int email( endpoint.Id ) email unique id string max(epochms()) IF event_type IN (\"_email.open\", \"_email.click\") last_active_ts Last Active date max(epochms()) IF eq(event_type, \"_email.open\") pinpoint_last_open_ts Pinpoint Last Open date max(epochms()) IF eq(event_type, \"click\") pinpoint_lastclick_ts Pinpoint Last Click date min(epochms()) IF eq(event_type, \"click\") pinpoint_firstclick_ts Pinpoint First Click date valuect(hourofday()) IF eq(event_type, \"_email.open\") pinpoint_hourly_open Pinpoint Hourly event_types map[string]intsum valuect(hourofweek()) IF eq(event_type, \"_email.open\") pinpoint_hourofweek Pinpoint Hour of Week event_types map[string]intsum valuect(yymm()) IF eq(event_type, \"_email.open\") pinpoint_monthly Pinpoint Opens By Month map[string]intsum Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an import of Pinpoint activity in the Lytics platform. If you are new to creating jobs in Lytics, see the Data Sources documentation for more information. Select Amazon AWS Services from the list of providers. Select the Import Activity Data job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. From the Region input, enter the AWS region that the Kinesis stream resides in (e.g. us-east-1 ). From the Kinesis Stream input, enter the AWS Kinesis stream that is connected to the Pinpoint activity. Click Start Import . If activity data is avaiable in the Kinesis Pinpoint stream, the data will appear in Lytics within a few minutes. Export Audiences Export Lytics audiences to add audience membership data to your Pinpoint endpoints, and send targeted notifications using Pinpoint as users enter or exit Lytics audiences. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration . Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : User fields. This integration utilizes the Pinpoint REST APIs to send Pinpoint events that set an attribute for a Pinpoint Endpoint as a user enters or exits an audience in Lytics. As users enter or exit the Lytics audience, a new event is sent with the identifier lytics_audience with the slug of the exported Lytics audience. For example, lytics_highly_engaged is sent with the value true if they have entered the audience, and false if they have exited the audience. When building a campaign in Pinpoint, this attribute can be used to trigger a send event. In the Pinpoint campaign setup step \"Choose when to send the campaign\" you can target the attribute Lytics Audience for when the exported Lytics audience slug is set to true . The Lytics audience is also added as a Pinpoint endpoint attribute which can be used in Pinpoint to create custom segments. Fields By default, Lytics exports the following fields to Pinpoint. Lytics User Field Description Pinpoint Field Type custom Address Field Address for channel string Audience Exported Audience lytics_audience bool Configuration Follow these steps to set up and configure an export of a Lytics audience to Pinpoint. Select Amazon AWS Services from the list of providers. Select the Export Audiences job type from the list. Select the Authorization you would like to use or create a new one . Enter a Label to identify this job you are creating in Lytics. (Optional) Enter a Description for further context on your job. From the Audience input, select Lytics Audiences to emit events from. Each enter/exit event from the selected audience will be sent as a Pinpoint email event. From the Region input, select the AWS region that Pinpoint resides in (e.g. us-east-2 ). From the Pinpoint Project input, select your Pinpoint Project. From the Pinpoint Channel Type input, select the channel type, e.g., Email or SMS, to send to (channel must first be activated in Pinpoint). From the Address Field input, select the Lytics field that contains the user's endpoint address for the selected channel, e.g. \"Email Address\" if the selected channel type is \"EMAIL\". (Optional) From the User ID Field input, select the Lytics field that contains the user's unique ID that is used in Pinpoint to tie channel endpoints together. Select the Existing Users checkbox to send an enter event for users who are already in the selected Lytics audience. Click Start Export . If the Existing Users option is selected, audience data should be in Pinpoint within minutes. Otherwise, data will be seen when a new user enters or exits the exported audience. In Pinpoint, segments can be created to target the Lytics audience by defining a segment with the exported Lytics segment slug name set to true. Export Audience Triggers You can use Lytics to send messages to your customers via various AWS Pinpoint channels (Email/SMS/GCM/APNS) when they enter a Lytics audience. Integration Details Implementation Type : Server-side Integration . Implementation Technique : REST API Integration ( Audience Trigger Integration ). Frequency : Real-time Integration . Resulting data : A notification message sent to users entering the selected Lytics audiences. The message can be populated with Lytics profile data for the user depending on the job configuration . The job uses the Pinpoint API to send the Email , SMS , APNS and GCM messages. Before you can set up this job, you must enable the desired channel in your AWS Pinpoint project via which you would like to send a notification message. Once started, this job will proceed as follows. If backfill is enabled, construct the message with the user fields (if any) and send the notification message to each user using the configured channel. For each user entering the selected audience, construct the message with the user fields (if any) and send the notification message using the configured channel. Fields As mentioned above, the notification message can be configured with user fields so that it can be populated with corresponding user field values and the resulting message will be sent to the user using your chosen AWS Pinpoint channels .
